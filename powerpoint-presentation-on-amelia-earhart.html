                                            Amelia Earhart At the age of 23, Amelia Earhart took a ten-minute plane ride at a 1920 air show that changed her life—she knew she had to learn to fly. Because of her determination, she became a world-famous pilot. She also became a vice president in the airline industry. As a spokeswoman, she wrote and lectured about the time when flying would not be just for a few but would become an accepted part of everyday life. Earhart not only was inspirational to pilots, she broke down barriers for women. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. And that was just one of the many records she set throughout her career. Included in her accomplishments was being the first person to fly from Hawaii to California. She became the first person to make solo flights across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. All of these achievements opened opportunities for women in aviation. In 1937, Earhart attempted the first around-the-world flight at the equator. While attempting the stretch between New Guinea and Howland Island, a small island in the Pacific, Earhart and her navigator, Frederick Noonan, vanished. They were nearly two-thirds finished with the journey. No one ever found their bodies or the ultimate cause of their deaths. Recently, a piece of aluminum found on a small Pacific island called Nikumaroro is believed to match a piece that was used to repair Earhart’s plane. Though Earhart died, her legacy of freedom, determination, and living out your dreams has lived on. READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS: 1. What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage? 2.

                            1. family background of amelia earhart</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Amelia Mary Earhart </strong>is an American aviator and author, who disappeared on July 2, 1937 on the Pacific Ocean due to insufficient plane gas that resulted to a crash, on her route to Howland Island from Lae, Papua New Guinea.</p><p>Amelia Mary Earhart was born to Amelia Otis and Samuel Stanton Earhart, a lawyer on July 24, 1897 on Atchison, Kansas on the home of her maternal grandfather, Alfred Gideon Otis. Amelia was the second child of the couple, next to her sister, Grace Muriel Earhart and was named after two grandmothers, Amelia Josephine Harres and Mary Wells Patton. </p><p>Alfred first disapproved the marriage and was not satisfied with Samuel's progress as a lawyer.</p><p>From an early age, Amelia became the ringleader and her sister on the other hand, became the obedient and dutiful daughter. She was nicknamed "Meeley", and her sister, "Pidge". Raising the two girls into proper adulthood became uncomfortable and unconventional for Amelia, since she believed that there are no such things as "nice little girls". Meanwhile, their grandmother did not approved the "bloomers" worn by the sisters, although the parents granted them the freedom to do so.</p><p>While the family's finances seemingly improved with the acquisition of a new house and even the hiring of two servants, it soon became apparent that Edwin was an alcoholic. Five years later in 1914, he was forced to retire and although he attempted to rehabilitate himself through treatment, he was never reinstated at the Rock Island Railroad. At about this time, Earhart's grandmother Amelia Otis died suddenly, leaving a substantial estate that placed her daughter's share in a trust, fearing that Edwin's drinking would drain the funds. The Otis house was auctioned along with all of its contents; Earhart was heartbroken and later described it as the end of her childhood.</p><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: Amelia Earhart</strong> distinguished herself as a person who not only accomplished amazing feats but also drew from the symbolic capital of those feats to articulate new visions of women in society. She spent more time writing about her flights and what she hoped they meant for others than she ever spent in the sky. As a magazine editor, author of countless news and magazine articles, and vice-president of public relations for a commercial airline, Earhart's rhetoric played a central role in 1920s and 1930s U.S. culture—albeit White, middle-to-upper-class, heterosexual culture—and modeled increasingly unconventional ways of communicating about gender and society within that context.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Amelia Earhart</strong> died mysteriously before she was forty. Yet in the last decade of her life, Amelia Earhart soared from obscurity to fame as the best-known female aviator in the world. She earned the title of first woman to fly solo over the Atlantic Ocean. Arguably the most popular and influential of Earhart's writings, The Fun of It chronicled her childhood, the history of White women in aviation, and her experiences soaring above the clouds, all while championing the idea that privileged womanhood and adventure-seeking were not mutually exclusive concepts.</p><p></p><p>For more information:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2105661</p><p></p><br />

This is a matter of making our dreams come true. A lot of things could hindrance us from what we want, but because of determination, anything can be possible. Just like Earhart, regardless of risk and gender, she pursued what she wanted. That's why we should never stop believing that things can be achieved, at the right place and at the right time. Earhart may have disappeared, forever, maybe it was all worth it and she could have discovered something that we don't know. </p><br />

Prince and Amelia Earhart’s story is the presence of airplanes. Both people
behind the stories and in the story are fascinated by planes. The Little Prince’s
author, Antoine de Sant-Exupery, is fascinated by planes, which were then
newly-invented. On the other hand, Earhart is a plane pilot.</p>

                            15. Amelia Earhart At the age of 23, Amelia Earhart took a ten-minute plane ride at a 1920 air show that changed her life—she knew she had to learn to fly. Because of her determination, she became a world-famous pilot. She also became a vice president in the airline industry. As a spokeswoman, she wrote and lectured about the time when flying would not be just for a few but would become an accepted part of everyday life. Earhart not only was inspirational to pilots, she broke down barriers for women. She was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. And that was just one of the many records she set throughout her career. Included in her accomplishments was being the first person to fly from Hawaii to California. She became the first person to make solo flights across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. All of these achievements opened opportunities for women in aviation. In 1937, Earhart attempted the first around-the-world flight at the equator. While attempting the stretch between New Guinea and Howland Island, a small island in the Pacific, Earhart and her navigator, Frederick Noonan, vanished. They were nearly two-thirds finished with the journey. No one ever found their bodies or the ultimate cause of their deaths. Recently, a piece of aluminum found on a small Pacific island called Nikumaroro is believed to match a piece that was used to repair Earhart’s plane. Though Earhart died, her legacy of freedom, determination, and living out your dreams has lived on. READING COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS: 1. What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage? 2.

                        Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was born in France in 1900, when airplanes were just being invented. Antoine dreamed of flying and grew up to be a pilot—and that was when his adventures began. He found a job delivering mail by plane, which had never been done before. He and his fellow pilots traveled to faraway places and discovered new ways of getting from one place to the next. Antoine flew over mountains and deserts. He battled winds and storms. He tried to break aviation records, and sometimes he even crashed. From his plane, Antoine looked down on the earth and was inspired to write about his life and his pilot-hero friends in memoirs and in fiction. Peter Sís's remarkable biography celebrates the author of The Little Prince.<br />
