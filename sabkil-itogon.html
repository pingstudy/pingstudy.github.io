                                            26. The following proves that humans have the capacity and ability to transcend despite the endless limitations that we have, EXCEPT one. *
a. It seems impossible to get rid of the corona virus because it is still invisible to everybody’s eyes and we can get infected by it anytime, anywhere.
b. It seems impossible for us humans to live on Mars, but NASA is continuously developing scientific expertise needed in order to equip humans to counter asteroids by the year 2025 and preparing space explorations bound for Mars by the year 2030.
c. It seems impossible to create our own sun because we are not simply the Creator (God). However, Chinese scientists have managed to create an artificial sun that could eventually be used as an inexhaustible source of power solving the world energy crisis.
d. It seems impossible to fly for we are not birds who have wings, but through intellect and will, the Wright Brothers were able to create the wright flyer of 1903 which was the first powered airplane to demonstrate sustainable flight under the full control of the pilot.
27. Which of the following situations supports this statement by Kaplan: “Hesitation marks the opening of possibility, attention marks the fixing of possibility, and choice marks the closing of possibility.” *
a. Anna Mae has given the opportunity to become an events host, for they were able to see the potential on her to be one someday. However, she doubted her skills and experiences for it’s her first time to become a host in a prestigious event. Because of it, she decided to decline the offer and wait for the perfect time that she will be ready.
b. Louie was appointed to become the project head of their company and he will be sent abroad. He became hesitant about it for he will be far away from his family, but then he realized that this has been his dream position ever since. So, he accepted the offer and believe in his self that he can do it.
c. Both A and B
d. None of the above
28. Floods, landslides, and wildfires are just of the many natural disasters that happens every year and in every part of the globe. However, as time passes by, these natural disasters became worse and caused detrimental effects to humans than ever before. With that, is there something we can do in order to prevent this? *
a. Yes. We can always pray to God and ask to stop these natural disasters to occur
b. No. Because as human beings, we don’t have any special powers to prevent something huge like natural disasters.
c. Yes. By eliminating human induced activities such as deforestation, illegal mining and quarrying, improper waste disposal and a lot more.
d. No. From the word itself, natural, so everything that happened inside our planet occurs naturally and we can’t really do something about it as humans.
29. Three years ago, on the same month of September, two massive landslides have occurred and devasted the town of Itogon in Benguet and the city of Naga in Cebu, which have claimed many lives and damage to properties. Both were triggered by their mountainsides getting soaked with water, however it was also aggravated by small-scale mining and a quarry near the landslide sites. With that, what is the best conclusion you can make from this phenomena? *
a. Landslides are naturally occurring disasters that are usually triggered by rainfalls brought by typhoons and monsoons. Since it happens naturally, we can’t really do something about it, but maybe evacuate, as soon as possible knowing that it is a landslide prone area.
b. There is mining and a quarry but it is not the sole reason why the landslides happen because during that time, the town of Itogon was affected by Typhoon Ompong(Mangkhut) and continuous rain in Naga City, Cebu brought by habagat or the southwest monsoon
c. Knowing that there is a small-scale mining and a quarry nearby, residents shouldn’t live there in the first place. People should settle and reside somewhere that are safer and not in a landslide prone area.
d. Landslides happen almost every year in the country, especially when there is heavy and continuous rainfall due to typhoon or monsoons. However, because of human induced activities such as mining and quarry operations, the aftermath worsen and it became more life threatening to the people residing in the area.</a>

What kind of summary lead is used? Activity 4: Sum Me: Read the summary notes and answer the given task. There are many ways of writing summary leads but most important of all is how to angle the facts from the most important to the least. This is very important in news writing in order to deliver the most essential details and to give the summary of the news events more so that readers would like to know the gist of the news story right away. That's the reason why summary leads are used at the beginning of news articles. Angling the 5ws and 1 H is identifying which among these is the most important to the least. Once you already arranged the facts, you can now write the summary lead by incorporating the basic structure/ pattern. Give the two important steps in writing summary leads 2. 3. Give two reasons why 4. we angle facts under the 5W's and 1H​</a>

Issue: The landslide in mining areas in Itogon due to Super typhoon Ompong had brought 74 casualties. • It is indeed an array of fulfillment asDepartment of Trade and Industry (DTI) agreed with Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to require mining companies to build bamboos in their areas. 3. Issue: Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno blamed the whopping 6.4% inflation rate on August as the highest in 10 years.• It is sure considered as failure since having inflation and rice deterioration is a burden to Philippine economy. It only conveys that the economy itself is being pulled down by these factors that need to be on top priority. 4. Issue: Changing the last lines of Lupang Hinirang, as proposed by Senate President Vicente Sotto III. • The alteration of the Philippine National Anthem denotes not only disrespect of history but also lack of government's accountability. If one is truly concerned for his country, then he must do his best and do what's right.5. Issue: Viral video of teenagers who had beaten an old man in the jeepney just to steal his purse. •This simple yet devastating crime committed by them is very alarming and the government should lower the criminal liability to 12 years old.(WALA PO ITONG KWENTO)​</a>

Marami nang namatay dahil natabunan ng lupa mula sa minimina. Marami na ring nasirang bundok, ilog, sapa at iba pang pinagkukunan ng kabuhayan ng mga tao. Sa simula lamang magbibigay nang ikabubuhay ang mga minahan pero kapag tumagal na, kapahamakan na walang katulad ang idudulot ng mga ito. Kaya ang sinabi ni President Duterte na ipahihinto niya ang pagmimina sa 2019 ay karapat-dapat. Magandang desisyon para maiwasan na ang pagkamatay ng mga tao at pagkasira ng kapaligiran.Kung walang nagmina sa Itogon, Benguet, hindi guguho ang lupa roon na umutang sa buhay ng 70 katao noong Setyembre 15. Hanggang sa kasalukuyan, patuloy pa rin ang paghahanap sa mga natabunan ng lupa.Sabi ng Presidente nang magsalita sa assembly ng rebel returnees sa Samar noong Martes, ipagbabawal na niya ang mining sa susunod na taon. Ayaw niya sa mining sapagkat sinisira ang kapaligiran. Sa Mindanao umano, ang open-pit mining ang dahilan kaya maraming butas ang mga kabundukan. Sa mga butas na ito naiipon. ang mga tubig na nagiging dahilan nang paghina ng lupa na nauuwi sa landslides.Ang matindi pa umano, ayon sa Presidente, P70 billion lang ang revenues na kinikita ng bansa sa mga mining companies. At ang halagang ito ay kulang pang pangpa repair sa mga nasira sa environment at pambayad sa mga namatay. Ayon sa Presidente P70 billion times five ang gastos sa pagsasaayos dahil sa mga nangyaring landslides, pero sira pa rin ang kalikasan.Marami nang nangyaring pagguho dahil sa pagmimina. Halimbawa ay ang gumuhong bundok sa Bgy. Guinsaugon, St. Bernard, Southen Leyte noong Peb. 17, 2006 na ikinamatay ng 1,100 tao. Buong barangay ang natabunan ng putik at mga bato. Pagmimina at illegal logging ang dahilan nitoGawain sa Pagkatuto Bilang 3:Gamit ang graphic organizer, isa-isahin ang mga argumento na nabasa sa teksto.

                            6. 26. The following proves that humans have the capacity and ability to transcend despite the endless limitations that we have, EXCEPT one. *
a. It seems impossible to get rid of the corona virus because it is still invisible to everybody’s eyes and we can get infected by it anytime, anywhere.
b. It seems impossible for us humans to live on Mars, but NASA is continuously developing scientific expertise needed in order to equip humans to counter asteroids by the year 2025 and preparing space explorations bound for Mars by the year 2030.
c. It seems impossible to create our own sun because we are not simply the Creator (God). However, Chinese scientists have managed to create an artificial sun that could eventually be used as an inexhaustible source of power solving the world energy crisis.
d. It seems impossible to fly for we are not birds who have wings, but through intellect and will, the Wright Brothers were able to create the wright flyer of 1903 which was the first powered airplane to demonstrate sustainable flight under the full control of the pilot.
27. Which of the following situations supports this statement by Kaplan: “Hesitation marks the opening of possibility, attention marks the fixing of possibility, and choice marks the closing of possibility.” *
a. Anna Mae has given the opportunity to become an events host, for they were able to see the potential on her to be one someday. However, she doubted her skills and experiences for it’s her first time to become a host in a prestigious event. Because of it, she decided to decline the offer and wait for the perfect time that she will be ready.
b. Louie was appointed to become the project head of their company and he will be sent abroad. He became hesitant about it for he will be far away from his family, but then he realized that this has been his dream position ever since. So, he accepted the offer and believe in his self that he can do it.
c. Both A and B
d. None of the above
28. Floods, landslides, and wildfires are just of the many natural disasters that happens every year and in every part of the globe. However, as time passes by, these natural disasters became worse and caused detrimental effects to humans than ever before. With that, is there something we can do in order to prevent this? *
a. Yes. We can always pray to God and ask to stop these natural disasters to occur
b. No. Because as human beings, we don’t have any special powers to prevent something huge like natural disasters.
c. Yes. By eliminating human induced activities such as deforestation, illegal mining and quarrying, improper waste disposal and a lot more.
d. No. From the word itself, natural, so everything that happened inside our planet occurs naturally and we can’t really do something about it as humans.
29. Three years ago, on the same month of September, two massive landslides have occurred and devasted the town of Itogon in Benguet and the city of Naga in Cebu, which have claimed many lives and damage to properties. Both were triggered by their mountainsides getting soaked with water, however it was also aggravated by small-scale mining and a quarry near the landslide sites. With that, what is the best conclusion you can make from this phenomena? *
a. Landslides are naturally occurring disasters that are usually triggered by rainfalls brought by typhoons and monsoons. Since it happens naturally, we can’t really do something about it, but maybe evacuate, as soon as possible knowing that it is a landslide prone area.
b. There is mining and a quarry but it is not the sole reason why the landslides happen because during that time, the town of Itogon was affected by Typhoon Ompong(Mangkhut) and continuous rain in Naga City, Cebu brought by habagat or the southwest monsoon
c. Knowing that there is a small-scale mining and a quarry nearby, residents shouldn’t live there in the first place. People should settle and reside somewhere that are safer and not in a landslide prone area.
d. Landslides happen almost every year in the country, especially when there is heavy and continuous rainfall due to typhoon or monsoons. However, because of human induced activities such as mining and quarry operations, the aftermath worsen and it became more life threatening to the people residing in the area.</h2><br />

Issue: Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno blamed the whopping 6.4% inflation rate on August as the highest in 10 years.• It is sure considered as failure since having inflation and rice deterioration is a burden to Philippine economy. It only conveys that the economy itself is being pulled down by these factors that need to be on top priority. 4. Issue: Changing the last lines of Lupang Hinirang, as proposed by Senate President Vicente Sotto III. • The alteration of the Philippine National Anthem denotes not only disrespect of history but also lack of government's accountability. If one is truly concerned for his country, then he must do his best and do what's right.5.

</p><p>B. The mangoes have no taste at all</p><p><strong>Answer: How many variety of mangoes do you have?</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>An <strong>interrogative sentence </strong>is a sentence that asks a question and ends in a question mark.  Interrogative sentences can be direct or indirect, begin with or without pronouns, and feature yes/no interrogatives, alternative questions, or tag questions. Interrogative sentences often start with interrogative pronouns and end with a question mark. Interrogative pronouns, typically “wh” words, include “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” “which,” “whose,” and “whom.”</p><p></p><p>EXAMPLES:</p>“Which sweater goes best with these pants?” This is an example of a direct question, a common form of an interrogative sentence.
“Would you be available to drive me?” This is an indirect question, as it is less direct than “Will you drive me?” It also uses the modal verb “would.” (Other modal verbs, which express possibility or modality, are “can,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “shall,” “might,” “may,” and “must.”)
“Are you more interested in dinosaurs or sharks?” This is an example of an alternative interrogative, also known as choice question since it offers the person being addressed a choice between two or more items. This sentence is using the auxiliary verb “are.”
“Do you remember all of your dreams?” This is a yes-no question, as it can be answered either in the affirmative or the negative.
“We’re going too fast, aren’t we?” This interrogative sentence uses a tag question at the end, separated by a comma, allowing the inquirer to seek confirmation of something they think might be the case.
“Can you believe he said that?” This type of interrogative is a rhetorical question, wherein no direct answer to the question is being sought. It is emphasizing an idea, in this case, disbelief.<p></p><p>You can visit this link to learn more about the<strong> different types of sentences</strong>:</p><p></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/70204</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST </strong></p><p></p><br />

                            29. EPagyamanin NatinIbawal ang Pagmimina (Pilipino Star Ngayon - October 5, 2018)7WALANG magandang idudulot ang pagmimina. Marami nang namatay dahil natabunan ng lupa mula sa minimina. Marami na ring nasirang bundok, ilog, sapa at iba pang pinagkukunan ng kabuhayan ng mga tao. Sa simula lamang magbibigay nang ikabubuhay ang mga minahan pero kapag tumagal na, kapahamakan na walang katulad ang idudulot ng mga ito. Kaya ang sinabi ni President Duterte na ipahihinto niya ang pagmimina sa 2019 ay karapat-dapat. Magandang desisyon para maiwasan na ang pagkamatay ng mga tao at pagkasira ng kapaligiran.Kung walang nagmina sa Itogon, Benguet, hindi guguho ang lupa roon na umutang sa buhay ng 70 katao noong Setyembre 15. Hanggang sa kasalukuyan, patuloy pa rin ang paghahanap sa mga natabunan ng lupa.Sabi ng Presidente nang magsalita sa assembly ng rebel returnees sa Samar noong Martes, ipagbabawal na niya ang mining sa susunod na taon. Ayaw niya sa mining sapagkat sinisira ang kapaligiran. Sa Mindanao umano, ang open-pit mining ang dahilan kaya maraming butas ang mga kabundukan. Sa mga butas na ito naiipon. ang mga tubig na nagiging dahilan nang paghina ng lupa na nauuwi sa landslides.Ang matindi pa umano, ayon sa Presidente, P70 billion lang ang revenues na kinikita ng bansa sa mga mining companies. At ang halagang ito ay kulang pang pangpa repair sa mga nasira sa environment at pambayad sa mga namatay. Ayon sa Presidente P70 billion times five ang gastos sa pagsasaayos dahil sa mga nangyaring landslides, pero sira pa rin ang kalikasan.Marami nang nangyaring pagguho dahil sa pagmimina. Halimbawa ay ang gumuhong bundok sa Bgy. Guinsaugon, St. Bernard, Southen Leyte noong Peb. 17, 2006 na ikinamatay ng 1,100 tao. Buong barangay ang natabunan ng putik at mga bato. Pagmimina at illegal logging ang dahilan nitoGawain sa Pagkatuto Bilang 3:Gamit ang graphic organizer, isa-isahin ang mga argumento na nabasa sa teksto.
