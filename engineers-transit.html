A. Directions: Read the text carefully and answer the following questions that follow.
Environmental pollution is one of the problems that we are facing in our modern world. Though 
there has been massive technological advancement in these recent days, it has also invited negative 
effects to the environment. By doing a simple thing like planting a tree, we shall be making the world 
a better place and for sure we shall always live to be proud of our achievement.
Experts say that proper handling of waste materials, such as reusing or disposing of them 
properly, should constitute an important part of our efforts to preserve energy and protect the 
environment. Countries worldwide should use less coal and more reusable power like hydro or solar 
power.
We can also make simple changes, like using reusable bags and containers. We should try 
and conserve electricity by turning off the lights, TV, or other electrical appliances when not in use. 
Buy less disposable products. Ban plastic. Buy more fuel-efficient cars (such as a hybrid or 
electric) and recycle your engine oil. Use public transit whenever possible. Let us walk more and drive 
less to conserve fuel and prevent auto-emission
We should avoid littering our roads and highways. And prevent others from doing so. Always 
dispose your litter properly. Littering is not just bad for the environment, it is also an offence carrying 
heavy fines
Plant trees to improve air quality. Take a stand against deforestation. Losing our rainforests 
means losing millions of trees that would otherwise be cleaning the air for us.

Environmental pollution is one of the problems that we are facing in our modern world. Though 
there has been massive technological advancement in these recent days, it has also invited negative 
effects to the environment. By doing a simple thing like planting a tree, we shall be making the world 
a better place and for sure we shall always live to be proud of our achievement.
Experts say that proper handling of waste materials, such as reusing or disposing of them 
properly, should constitute an important part of our efforts to preserve energy and protect the 
environment. Countries worldwide should use less coal and more reusable power like hydro or solar 
power.
We can also make simple changes, like using reusable bags and containers. We should try 
and conserve electricity by turning off the lights, TV, or other electrical appliances when not in use. 
Buy less disposable products. Ban plastic. Buy more fuel-efficient cars (such as a hybrid or 
electric) and recycle your engine oil. Use public transit whenever possible. Let us walk more and drive 
less to conserve fuel and prevent auto-emission
We should avoid littering our roads and highways. And prevent others from doing so. Always 
dispose your litter properly. Littering is not just bad for the environment, it is also an offence carrying 
heavy fines
Plant trees to improve air quality. Take a stand against deforestation. Losing our rainforests 
means losing millions of trees that would otherwise be cleaning the air for us.

Choose the sentence that would be the best topic sentenceand explain how it supports the details in the passage.1. Moving People A city train system can move 60,000 people an hour on each line. Expressways can manage only about 2,000 cars an hour in each lane.

The sound barrier had been broken, and Yeager brought the plane down safely. a. High-speed jet transport is taken for granted today.b. The day the sound barrier was broken was a milestone in aviation history. c. When a plane accelerates beyond the speed of sound, a loud roar can be heard.

Marine pilot William Rankin made history in 1959 when he survived a nine-mile fall from the sky. Over Norfolk,Virginia, Rankin had engine trouble and had to eject himself from his plane. After he had fallen for about eight minutes, his parachute opened perfectly. To his dismay, however, he found himself in the middle of a thunderstorm. The strong winds kept driving him up instead of down toward the earth. For forty minutes Rankin was tossed by fierce winds and surrounded by blasts of thunder and sheets of lightning. Finally he reached the ground, frostbitten and injured, but alive. Soon after, newspapers all around the world honored "the man who rode the thunder."Concluding Statement: Title of the Passage:
4. The bitterly cold climate of Antarctica is hostile to many forms of life. Even the emperor penguin, which thrives in the cold, has had to develop unusual -behaviors to hatch a chick. If an egg were allowed to touch the frozen ground, the developing chick inside would not survive. To protect the chick, the male penguin carries the egg on his feet, tucking it under the feathers on his body. For two months, while the female penguin is away storing food in her belly, the male goes nowhere without the egg on his feet. Cuddled securely in the male's warmth, the chick can survive until hatching. At that time the mother returns and takes over the care of her newborn chick. Even then the down-covered chick needs its mother's feet and feathers to shield it from the frigid weather of AntarcticaConcluding Statement: Title of the Passage:5. Imagine the feeling of suddenly having all of your weight lifted from you. You glide along almost without effort. You feel the coolness of water around you. You see the brilliant colors of fish swimming past you, and the sounds of the world outside are muffled. These are just a few of the pleasures of snorkeling. For those who have mastered the basic techniques, however, the pleasures are even greater. Instead of simply gliding andobserving, an experienced snorkeler can keep busy underwater with several interesting activities.Concluding Statement: Title of the Passage:</a>

A. Directions: Read the text carefully and answer the following questions that follow.
Environmental pollution is one of the problems that we are facing in our modern world. Though 
there has been massive technological advancement in these recent days, it has also invited negative 
effects to the environment. By doing a simple thing like planting a tree, we shall be making the world 
a better place and for sure we shall always live to be proud of our achievement.
Experts say that proper handling of waste materials, such as reusing or disposing of them 
properly, should constitute an important part of our efforts to preserve energy and protect the 
environment. Countries worldwide should use less coal and more reusable power like hydro or solar 
power.
We can also make simple changes, like using reusable bags and containers. We should try 
and conserve electricity by turning off the lights, TV, or other electrical appliances when not in use. 
Buy less disposable products. Ban plastic. Buy more fuel-efficient cars (such as a hybrid or 
electric) and recycle your engine oil. Use public transit whenever possible. Let us walk more and drive 
less to conserve fuel and prevent auto-emission
We should avoid littering our roads and highways. And prevent others from doing so. Always 
dispose your litter properly. Littering is not just bad for the environment, it is also an offence carrying 
heavy fines
Plant trees to improve air quality. Take a stand against deforestation. Losing our rainforests 
means losing millions of trees that would otherwise be cleaning the air for us.

Environmental pollution is one of the problems that we are facing in our modern world. Though 
there has been massive technological advancement in these recent days, it has also invited negative 
effects to the environment. By doing a simple thing like planting a tree, we shall be making the world 
a better place and for sure we shall always live to be proud of our achievement.
Experts say that proper handling of waste materials, such as reusing or disposing of them 
properly, should constitute an important part of our efforts to preserve energy and protect the 
environment. Countries worldwide should use less coal and more reusable power like hydro or solar 
power.
We can also make simple changes, like using reusable bags and containers. We should try 
and conserve electricity by turning off the lights, TV, or other electrical appliances when not in use. 
Buy less disposable products. Ban plastic. Buy more fuel-efficient cars (such as a hybrid or 
electric) and recycle your engine oil. Use public transit whenever possible. Let us walk more and drive 
less to conserve fuel and prevent auto-emission
We should avoid littering our roads and highways. And prevent others from doing so. Always 
dispose your litter properly. Littering is not just bad for the environment, it is also an offence carrying 
heavy fines
Plant trees to improve air quality. Take a stand against deforestation. Losing our rainforests 
means losing millions of trees that would otherwise be cleaning the air for us.

Marine pilot William Rankin made history in 1959 when he survived a nine-mile fall from the sky. Over Norfolk,Virginia, Rankin had engine trouble and had to eject himself from his plane. After he had fallen for about eight minutes, his parachute opened perfectly. To his dismay, however, he found himself in the middle of a thunderstorm. The strong winds kept driving him up instead of down toward the earth. For forty minutes Rankin was tossed by fierce winds and surrounded by blasts of thunder and sheets of lightning. Finally he reached the ground, frostbitten and injured, but alive. Soon after, newspapers all around the world honored "the man who rode the thunder."Concluding Statement: Title of the Passage:
4. The bitterly cold climate of Antarctica is hostile to many forms of life. Even the emperor penguin, which thrives in the cold, has had to develop unusual -behaviors to hatch a chick. If an egg were allowed to touch the frozen ground, the developing chick inside would not survive. To protect the chick, the male penguin carries the egg on his feet, tucking it under the feathers on his body. For two months, while the female penguin is away storing food in her belly, the male goes nowhere without the egg on his feet. Cuddled securely in the male's warmth, the chick can survive until hatching. At that time the mother returns and takes over the care of her newborn chick. Even then the down-covered chick needs its mother's feet and feathers to shield it from the frigid weather of AntarcticaConcluding Statement: Title of the Passage:5. Imagine the feeling of suddenly having all of your weight lifted from you. You glide along almost without effort. You feel the coolness of water around you. You see the brilliant colors of fish swimming past you, and the sounds of the world outside are muffled. These are just a few of the pleasures of snorkeling. For those who have mastered the basic techniques, however, the pleasures are even greater. Instead of simply gliding andobserving, an experienced snorkeler can keep busy underwater with several interesting activities.Concluding Statement: Title of the Passage:</h2><br />
