Do this in your answer sheet.Gaea Katreena CabicoNew coronavirus mutation found in the PhilippinesA mutation of the novel coronavirus believed to be more infectious than the original variant has been detected in the Philippines, genomic researchers said.The new mutation of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been reported to have become the dominantcoronavirus strain circulating around the world. Researchers called the new strain G614. When the outbreak began in thecountry last March, the original D614 genotype showed up in the positive samples collected by the Philippine Genome Center (PGC). But in a new study, genomic researchers detected both the D614 and the G614."We now report the detection of the D614 variant among nine randomly selected COVID-19 positive samples collected in Quezon City in July. In the month of June, both the D614 as well as the G614 have been detected in a small sample of positive cases." PGC said in an August 13 bulletin."Although this information confirms the presence of G614 in the Philippines, we note that all the samples tested were fromQuezon City and may not represent the mutational landscape for the whole country," it added.Last month, researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Duke University in North Carolina published a study that a specific change in SARS-CoV-2 virus genome is more infectious in cell culture. The team analyzed the data of 999 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and observed that those infected with G614 had more viral particles in them.They, however, did not find evidence of G614 impact on disease severity. In other words, it was not significantly associated with hospitalization status."There is still no definitive evidence showing that camers of the G614 variant are actually more transmissible than thosewith D614, and the mutation does not appear to substantially affect clinical outcomes as well," PGC said. The genome center stressed the importance of continuously monitoring G614 to help formulate containment, diagnosticand therapeutic strategies: "Itong sinasabi, cila na D614G mutation may higher possibility na mas transmissible siya, mas higher ang level niya na makaka-transmit sya sa iba or infectious. Pero wala pa rin tayong solid evidence to say na yan talaga ay mangyayad." Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a media forum Monday. (They say D614G mutation has higher possibility that it is transmissible, it has higher level that it can transmit to others orinfectious. But we still don't have solid evidence to say that will happen.)She also said that the PGC has been authorized by the DOH to continue the study to gather more information about thevirus. The novel coronavirus has so far infected 161 253 people in the country despite imposing one of the longest andstrictest lockdowns. Of the figure, 112,586 have recovered and 2,665 have died.Questions:1. What is the main topic of this report? 2. Is the overall purpose of the report clear?

                                            Panuto: Isulat mo ang iyong pananaw batay sa nabasang teksto.MAYNILA — Posibleng bumaba na sa 5,000 hanggang 6,000 ang bilang ng mga bagong COVID-19 cases na naitatala kada araw sa bansa sa katapusan ng Oktubre, sabi ngayong Linggo ng OCTA Research Group. Sinabi ni Professor Guido David ng OCTA Research na tuloy-tuloy ang pagbuti ng mga datos sa COVID-19 sa mga nakalipas na araw dahil hindi na umaabot ng 10,000 ang bilang ng mga bagong kaso. Ayon kay David, nasa 0.64 na lang ang reproduction number sa buong bansa at 8,400 ang 7-day average cases. Bumababa na rin aniya ang hospital utilization rate, batay sa datos ng Department of Health. Sa Metro Manila, nasa 47 porsiyento na lang umano ito. Sa kabila nito, mataas pa rin ang intensive care unit (ICU) utilization rate. Ipinagpapalagay ni David na ang mas nakahahawang Delta variant ang sanhi ng marami pa ring ICU cases sa ngayon. Dahil sa pagbuti ng datos, ibinaba na sa Alert Level 3 mula Level 4 ang Metro Manila simula nitong Sabado. Pero nagpahayag ng pangamba ang isang grupo ng mga doktor sa pagluluwag. Ayon kay Dr. Maricar Limpin ng Philippine College of Physicians, tuwing nagluluwag kasi ng restrictions, "medyo may kasamang pagkalimot" ang mga Pilipino sa pagsunod sa health protocols. Iginiit din ni Limpin na puno pa rin ang mga ospital at baka hindi makayanan ng pamahalaan na rumesponde sakaling sumipa ulit ang mga kaso.​</a>

                                            Exercise B Directions: Read the following paragraph and answer the following questions on a separate sheet of paper. The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the ff questions.The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrollees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. questions:1. What do you think is the stand of the author?

Do this in your answer sheet.Gaea Katreena CabicoNew coronavirus mutation found in the PhilippinesA mutation of the novel coronavirus believed to be more infectious than the original variant has been detected in the Philippines, genomic researchers said.The new mutation of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been reported to have become the dominantcoronavirus strain circulating around the world. Researchers called the new strain G614. When the outbreak began in thecountry last March, the original D614 genotype showed up in the positive samples collected by the Philippine Genome Center (PGC). But in a new study, genomic researchers detected both the D614 and the G614."We now report the detection of the D614 variant among nine randomly selected COVID-19 positive samples collected in Quezon City in July. In the month of June, both the D614 as well as the G614 have been detected in a small sample of positive cases." PGC said in an August 13 bulletin."Although this information confirms the presence of G614 in the Philippines, we note that all the samples tested were fromQuezon City and may not represent the mutational landscape for the whole country," it added.Last month, researchers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Duke University in North Carolina published a study that a specific change in SARS-CoV-2 virus genome is more infectious in cell culture. The team analyzed the data of 999 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and observed that those infected with G614 had more viral particles in them.They, however, did not find evidence of G614 impact on disease severity. In other words, it was not significantly associated with hospitalization status."There is still no definitive evidence showing that camers of the G614 variant are actually more transmissible than thosewith D614, and the mutation does not appear to substantially affect clinical outcomes as well," PGC said. The genome center stressed the importance of continuously monitoring G614 to help formulate containment, diagnosticand therapeutic strategies: "Itong sinasabi, cila na D614G mutation may higher possibility na mas transmissible siya, mas higher ang level niya na makaka-transmit sya sa iba or infectious. Pero wala pa rin tayong solid evidence to say na yan talaga ay mangyayad." Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a media forum Monday. (They say D614G mutation has higher possibility that it is transmissible, it has higher level that it can transmit to others orinfectious. But we still don't have solid evidence to say that will happen.)She also said that the PGC has been authorized by the DOH to continue the study to gather more information about thevirus. The novel coronavirus has so far infected 161 253 people in the country despite imposing one of the longest andstrictest lockdowns. Of the figure, 112,586 have recovered and 2,665 have died.Questions:1. What is the main topic of this report? 2. Is the overall purpose of the report clear?

Sinabi ni Professor Guido David ng OCTA Research na tuloy-tuloy ang pagbuti ng mga datos sa COVID-19 sa mga nakalipas na araw dahil hindi na umaabot ng 10,000 ang bilang ng mga bagong kaso. Ayon kay David, nasa 0.64 na lang ang reproduction number sa buong bansa at 8,400 ang 7-day average cases. Bumababa na rin aniya ang hospital utilization rate, batay sa datos ng Department of Health. Sa Metro Manila, nasa 47 porsiyento na lang umano ito. Sa kabila nito, mataas pa rin ang intensive care unit (ICU) utilization rate. Ipinagpapalagay ni David na ang mas nakahahawang Delta variant ang sanhi ng marami pa ring ICU cases sa ngayon. Dahil sa pagbuti ng datos, ibinaba na sa Alert Level 3 mula Level 4 ang Metro Manila simula nitong Sabado. Pero nagpahayag ng pangamba ang isang grupo ng mga doktor sa pagluluwag. Ayon kay Dr. Maricar Limpin ng Philippine College of Physicians, tuwing nagluluwag kasi ng restrictions, "medyo may kasamang pagkalimot" ang mga Pilipino sa pagsunod sa health protocols. Iginiit din ni Limpin na puno pa rin ang mga ospital at baka hindi makayanan ng pamahalaan na rumesponde sakaling sumipa ulit ang mga kaso.​</h2><br />

The K to 12 Program was introduced in the Philippines with the aim of providing sufficient time to master concepts and skills, prepare graduates for higher education, produce lifelong learners, and prepare students for middle level skills development, entrepreneurship, and employment (Republic of the Philippines Official Gazette). Hence, the program added two years of Senior High School (SHS). The courses The courses that can be learned from SHS include accounting, welding, machinist work, agriculture, music, medical technology, and culinary and hospitality work. Although the intention of adding SHS is commendable, some critics claim that there is still a mismatch between our schooling system and working system. As regards the implementation of SHS, some people are concerned about the lack of learning materials provided to the schools. For example, during the school year 2013-2014, learning materials for one school in Tondo arrived during the last two quarters of the school year. The lack of sufficient facilities, such as classrooms, chairs, and computer laboratories, is also a problem. Moreover, more students require more teachers, but there seems to be a lack of teachers as well. Colleges and universities also assert that they will be losing revenues with the implementation of SHS since there will be no enrolees for the first year in 2016. Despite these observations, DepEd is optimistic that these shortages and problems will be overcome as they claim that these are being addressed. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of Private Education Association (COCOPEA) lauds DepEd's writing implementation of the K to 12 Program. According to its chairman, additional two years of education should not be seen as a burden. Source: Barrot, Jessie S., Academic Reading &amp; Writing for Senior High School.

While the author presents both the commendable intention and the concerns of critics, the text does not explicitly state whether the author is for or against the implementation of SHS.</strong></p><p><strong>2. The central claim of the text is that the implementation of the K to 12 Program in the Philippines, particularly the addition of two years of Senior High School (SHS), has both positive and negative effects on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>3. The target reader of the text is likely to be educators, policymakers, and the general public who are interested in the current state of education in the Philippines and the effects of the K to 12 Program on the education system and its stakeholders.</strong></p><p><strong>4. When the text was written, the implementation of the K to 12 Program, which adds two years of Senior High School (SHS) to the Philippines' educational system, was ongoing. The author discusses the program's aim, which includes providing students with more time to master concepts and skills, preparing them for higher education and middle-level skills development, and producing lifelong learners. The author also highlights some concerns and criticisms of the program, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, and the potential loss of revenues for colleges and universities. The author also notes that while some people criticize the implementation of SHS, others praise it, indicating that it is a controversial issue that has elicited different reactions from various stakeholders. The text aims to provide information about the implementation of the K to 12 Program and to present different perspectives on its effectiveness and impact.</strong></p><p><strong>5. The text presents both the positive and negative effects of the implementation of SHS. There are valid concerns raised by critics, such as the lack of learning materials, facilities, and teachers, as well as the potential revenue loss of colleges and universities. However, the DepEd is optimistic that these problems will be addressed, and some private educational associations commend the implementation of the K to 12 Program. Therefore, there is evidence both for and against SHS, and it is up to policymakers and stakeholders to carefully weigh these factors when making decisions about education reform.<br />6. The effectiveness of the implementation of SHS in the Philippines is a matter of ongoing debate, and opinions may vary depending on various factors, such as personal experiences, beliefs, and the current state of education in the country. Some people may argue that the additional two years of education provide students with more time to develop their skills and prepare for their future careers. On the other hand, others may argue that it is too long and puts a strain on students and their families, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Based on my knowledge, I cannot make a definitive statement on whether SHS should continue to be implemented or not. However, it is essential to evaluate the implementation of SHS continually, monitor its effects, and address any issues that may arise to ensure that it benefits its stakeholders and achieves its intended goals.</strong></p><br />
