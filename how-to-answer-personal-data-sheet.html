I love knowing about a country’s traditional clothing, food and language. What I really love the most is that people suddenly light up when they're asked about their background. It is said in a manner of interest, rather than hate that is spread so easily nowadays. It is important to embrace cultures and for people to be proud of it (within limits of course) and the reaction that I get when I ask is always what gives me the biggest satisfaction.</p><br />
