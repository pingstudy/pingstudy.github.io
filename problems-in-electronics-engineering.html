                                            [UNRELATED]❗PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME TO READ❗This is Peter Kalmus, a NASA scientist and Climate Activist who's recently got arrested alongside with other activist by the cops because of their PEACEFUL PROTEST. He said that we only got less than 3 years to fix our climate before we will face catastrophic consequences of Global Warming and the government didn't do something. They want to end the use of fossil fuels and other bad sources of energy that rises the temperature of our environment.We are clearly facing the consequences slowly like how numbers cyclones recently increased and caused a major impact to our country like Typhoon Odette and Bagyong Agaton. Global Warming is also a major cause of natural disasters such as Cyclones and recent study shows that the global temperature increased for the last few decades.Sadly, most people don't even care and government doesn't listen and industrial companies are still continually destroying our planet. It's is so sad people like Peter Kalmus and Greta Thunberg are risking their lives just for the good of our lives, for our planet, and also for the future generation.HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP OUR CLIMATE:●Lessen the use of fossil fuels and find renewable source if possible.●Avoid burning garbages, this is one of our normalized hobbit but it needs to be stopped especially if most of the trash are made with plastic which is a made of carbon.●Save energy and supplies.● Donate and support Non-governmental Organizations activities that help fight Global warming.People like Peter and other activist gives us hope for humanity even though they risked their lives for our future and to the children of this generation. They show how selfish and unconcerned the government and the industry just for the sake of economy and money. #econotegoLet's fight those problems together.Show love to our Mother Earth ❤#LetTheEarthBreath#SaveMotherNature#ProtectOurPlanet:¨·.·¨: `·.Let the earth breath‼️SIMPLE WAYS TO HELP!SPREAD THIS ‼️ways to help :- delete unwanted emails- save electricity- save water- drive less- plant more trees- avoid smoking- unplug electronics u don’t use- use electric fan instead of aircon- use LED lights- spread awareness to your family and friends#LetTheEarthBreathe #ScienceProtestPlease don't ignore and take time to read these.NASA scientists got arrested for protesting about climate and according to the scientists we only have 4-5 years to save earth.

                                            CNO GRADE 7 JAN PA ANSWER NG REFLECTION HAHA
Scientists study the world by asking questions about it and seeking science-based answers. This method is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used in ancient times, but it was first documented by Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) of England, who set up inductive methods for scientific investigation. The scientific method can be applied to all fields of study as a reasonable, rational, problem solving technique. The scientific procedure typically starts with an observation that leads to an inquiry. An example of how these components are used is given in the chart below.In this lesson, you will learn concepts about elements and compounds. Remember that substances in matter are broken down into two categories. They can either be pure substances or mixtures. Pure substances are further broken down into elements and compounds. Any substance is composed of one type of atom or molecule. Whereas, mixtures are composed of different types of atoms or molecules that are not chemically bonded.
At the end of the lesson and each learning activity, you will be able to recognize that substances are classified into elements and compounds.
The 100 plus elements in the Periodic Table are the "alphabet" of matter because every tangible material is a combinations of these elements.
The elements are categorized as: Metals, Non-metals, Metalloid and Noble Gases. This main categorization is based on the electrical attributes of the elements. Some elements tend to "lose" an electron, and become positively charged.
(These are the metals), other elements tend to "acquire" an electron, and become negatively charged, (the non-metals). The third group, (metalloids), fall in between these two extremes. And the Noble Gas category -- displays no interest in either acquiring or losing an electron, but unlike the metalloids which can be "persuaded" one way or the other -- the
noble ones simply don't engage.
Since chemical reaction and chemical bonding are electrical in nature, it so happens that members of a certain category can substitute for another member and thereby create a combination which is slightly different, but generally

CASE Study 1Echo ElectronicsPaul Sanchez is the production manager for Echo Electronics, a small company that makes and distributes communications equipment. Paul’s direct subordinates are the supervisors of the four production departments in the company’s manufacturing plant. Six months ago, the engineering manager at Echo Electronics proposed a plan to install new computerized workstations to increase productivity in the plant. It seemed to be a good idea to Paul, and he welcomed the change. The CEO also ap- proved the plan, and the new equipment was installed immediately.Three months later, Paul was surprised and disappointed to find that the ex- pected increase in productivity did not occur. In fact, productivity and quality actually decreased. The marketing manager told Paul that several of their best customers complained about receiving Echo equipment that was defective. Paul does not believe that the problem lies with the new workstations. Technicians from the firm that built the workstations recently checked them and found that they were operating properly. Paul talked to someone at another company that uses the workstations, and his contact reported that they were having great success with them.When Paul discussed the problem with his four production supervisors, he found that they shared his concern but did not agree among themselves about the cause of the problem. Reasons given for the decline in performance included poor design of the workstations, inadequate training of the production workers who operate them, and lack of financial incentives for increasing productivity. The supervisors also told Paul that the production workers have strong feelings about the workstations. Morale de- clined, and two employees quit because they were upset about the changes made in the way the work is done.This morning Paul received a phone call from the CEO who just received the pro- duction figures for last month and was calling to express concern about them. The CEO indicated that the problem was Paul’s to solve, but he must take immediate steps to deal with it. The CEO wants to know by next week what steps Paul will take to reverse the decline in productivity and product quality.SOURCE: Adapted from a case by Timothy R. Hinkin and used with his permission.QUESTIONS1. What actions could Paul have taken to prevent the problem?2. What steps should Paul take now to deal with the problem?​</a>

                            7. [UNRELATED]❗PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME TO READ❗This is Peter Kalmus, a NASA scientist and Climate Activist who's recently got arrested alongside with other activist by the cops because of their PEACEFUL PROTEST. He said that we only got less than 3 years to fix our climate before we will face catastrophic consequences of Global Warming and the government didn't do something. They want to end the use of fossil fuels and other bad sources of energy that rises the temperature of our environment.We are clearly facing the consequences slowly like how numbers cyclones recently increased and caused a major impact to our country like Typhoon Odette and Bagyong Agaton. Global Warming is also a major cause of natural disasters such as Cyclones and recent study shows that the global temperature increased for the last few decades.Sadly, most people don't even care and government doesn't listen and industrial companies are still continually destroying our planet. It's is so sad people like Peter Kalmus and Greta Thunberg are risking their lives just for the good of our lives, for our planet, and also for the future generation.HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP OUR CLIMATE:●Lessen the use of fossil fuels and find renewable source if possible.●Avoid burning garbages, this is one of our normalized hobbit but it needs to be stopped especially if most of the trash are made with plastic which is a made of carbon.●Save energy and supplies.● Donate and support Non-governmental Organizations activities that help fight Global warming.People like Peter and other activist gives us hope for humanity even though they risked their lives for our future and to the children of this generation. They show how selfish and unconcerned the government and the industry just for the sake of economy and money. #econotegoLet's fight those problems together.Show love to our Mother Earth ❤#LetTheEarthBreath#SaveMotherNature#ProtectOurPlanet:¨·.·¨: `·.Let the earth breath‼️SIMPLE WAYS TO HELP!SPREAD THIS ‼️ways to help :- delete unwanted emails- save electricity- save water- drive less- plant more trees- avoid smoking- unplug electronics u don’t use- use electric fan instead of aircon- use LED lights- spread awareness to your family and friends#LetTheEarthBreathe #ScienceProtestPlease don't ignore and take time to read these.NASA scientists got arrested for protesting about climate and according to the scientists we only have 4-5 years to save earth.

                            8. CNO GRADE 7 JAN PA ANSWER NG REFLECTION HAHA
Scientists study the world by asking questions about it and seeking science-based answers. This method is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used in ancient times, but it was first documented by Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) of England, who set up inductive methods for scientific investigation. The scientific method can be applied to all fields of study as a reasonable, rational, problem solving technique. The scientific procedure typically starts with an observation that leads to an inquiry. An example of how these components are used is given in the chart below.In this lesson, you will learn concepts about elements and compounds. Remember that substances in matter are broken down into two categories. They can either be pure substances or mixtures. Pure substances are further broken down into elements and compounds. Any substance is composed of one type of atom or molecule. Whereas, mixtures are composed of different types of atoms or molecules that are not chemically bonded.
At the end of the lesson and each learning activity, you will be able to recognize that substances are classified into elements and compounds.
The 100 plus elements in the Periodic Table are the "alphabet" of matter because every tangible material is a combinations of these elements.
The elements are categorized as: Metals, Non-metals, Metalloid and Noble Gases. This main categorization is based on the electrical attributes of the elements. Some elements tend to "lose" an electron, and become positively charged.
(These are the metals), other elements tend to "acquire" an electron, and become negatively charged, (the non-metals). The third group, (metalloids), fall in between these two extremes. And the Noble Gas category -- displays no interest in either acquiring or losing an electron, but unlike the metalloids which can be "persuaded" one way or the other -- the
noble ones simply don't engage.
Since chemical reaction and chemical bonding are electrical in nature, it so happens that members of a certain category can substitute for another member and thereby create a combination which is slightly different, but generally
similar. Say then that by carefully choosing a replacement element in a chemical compound, it is possible to "engineer" a desired slight change in the nature of the compound. This used to be an art, and now is the science of chemistry.</h2><br />

CASE Study 1Echo ElectronicsPaul Sanchez is the production manager for Echo Electronics, a small company that makes and distributes communications equipment. Paul’s direct subordinates are the supervisors of the four production departments in the company’s manufacturing plant. Six months ago, the engineering manager at Echo Electronics proposed a plan to install new computerized workstations to increase productivity in the plant. It seemed to be a good idea to Paul, and he welcomed the change. The CEO also ap- proved the plan, and the new equipment was installed immediately.Three months later, Paul was surprised and disappointed to find that the ex- pected increase in productivity did not occur. In fact, productivity and quality actually decreased. The marketing manager told Paul that several of their best customers complained about receiving Echo equipment that was defective. Paul does not believe that the problem lies with the new workstations. Technicians from the firm that built the workstations recently checked them and found that they were operating properly. Paul talked to someone at another company that uses the workstations, and his contact reported that they were having great success with them.When Paul discussed the problem with his four production supervisors, he found that they shared his concern but did not agree among themselves about the cause of the problem. Reasons given for the decline in performance included poor design of the workstations, inadequate training of the production workers who operate them, and lack of financial incentives for increasing productivity. The supervisors also told Paul that the production workers have strong feelings about the workstations. Morale de- clined, and two employees quit because they were upset about the changes made in the way the work is done.This morning Paul received a phone call from the CEO who just received the pro- duction figures for last month and was calling to express concern about them. The CEO indicated that the problem was Paul’s to solve, but he must take immediate steps to deal with it. The CEO wants to know by next week what steps Paul will take to reverse the decline in productivity and product quality.SOURCE: Adapted from a case by Timothy R. Hinkin and used with his permission.QUESTIONS1. What actions could Paul have taken to prevent the problem?2. What steps should Paul take now to deal with the problem?​</h2><br />
