                                            Education, through its institutions such as schools, colleges and universities, has been understood and believed to represent the best hope for better future of Filipinos particularly the poor that comprise the majority of Filipinos.  Education, however, cannot deliver this as its capacity is defined and thus limited by the country’s dominant political and economic sectors that dictate what education institutions can and cannot do. For instance, schools, colleges and universities are made to accommodate expanding numbers of students without loss to the quality of teaching (and research) and learning. Its capacity to adapt curricula to fit the emerging requirements of highly diverse students is likewise limited and/or the institutions’ capacity to innovate their internal processes of teaching, assessing students, managing, etc. to respond to the needs of the broader education constituencies is likewise defined and limited by government’s prescribed provisions, systems, rules, regulations, and procedures.

At an advanced age, Melchora volunteered to help the Katipunan.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Humiliation</strong></p><p>Because cyberbullying occurs in cyberspace, online bullying feels permanent. Kids know that once something is out there, it will always be out there. They can feel exposed, embarrassed, and overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>When cyberbullying occurs, the nasty posts, messages, or texts can be shared with multitudes of people. The sheer volume of people that know about the bullying can lead to intense feelings of humiliation.1</p><p></p><p><strong>Isolation</strong></p><p>Cyberbullying sometimes causes kids to be excluded and ostracized at school. Consequently, they often feel alone and isolated.1 This experience can be particularly painful because friends are crucial at this age. When kids don’t have friends, this can lead to more bullying. </p><p></p><p>When cyberbullying occurs, parents sometimes recommend shutting off the computer or turning off the cell phone. But for many kids, using these devices is considered the most important way they communicate with others. Turning them off often means cutting off their connection with their world, which can make them feel more secluded.</p><p></p><p><strong>Powerless</strong></p><p>Victims of cyberbullying often find it difficult to feel safe. They may feel vulnerable and powerless. Typically, these feelings surface because the online bullying can invade their home through a computer or cell phone at any time of day. They no longer have a place where they can escape.1</p><p></p><p>To a victim, it can feel like cyberbullying is everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, because the bullies can remain anonymous, this realization may escalate feelings of fear.1 Sometimes kids who are targeted may have no idea who is inflicting the pain, although some cyberbullies choose people they know and have no problem identifying themselves.</p><p></p><p> Cyberbullies Who Target People They Know</p><p>Mental Effects of Cyberbullying</p><p>When cyberbullying is ongoing, victims may relate to the world around them differently than others.

And, in some cases, depression and thoughts of suicide can set in.</p><p></p><p><strong>Depression </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>anxiety</strong></p><p>Victims of cyberbullying may succumb to anxiety, depression, and other stress-related conditions. The added stress of coping with cyberbullying on a regular basis can steal their feelings of happiness and contentment. It also can increase feelings of worry and isolation.</p><p></p><p>Cyberbullying also can erode self-confidence and feelings of self-worth, which can contribute to depression and anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Research has consistently supported the notion that increasing levels of cyberbullying lead to higher levels of depression.

One major reason for this is that these writers were college students and young graduates whose literary education had been largely confined to American and English authors. Thus, the University of the Philippines, which was founded in 1908, became the center of the literary effort. Did you underline all six phrases? Now, let us group the phrases into three.

                            26. Education, through its institutions such as schools, colleges and universities, has been understood and believed to represent the best hope for better future of Filipinos particularly the poor that comprise the majority of Filipinos.  Education, however, cannot deliver this as its capacity is defined and thus limited by the country’s dominant political and economic sectors that dictate what education institutions can and cannot do. For instance, schools, colleges and universities are made to accommodate expanding numbers of students without loss to the quality of teaching (and research) and learning. Its capacity to adapt curricula to fit the emerging requirements of highly diverse students is likewise limited and/or the institutions’ capacity to innovate their internal processes of teaching, assessing students, managing, etc. to respond to the needs of the broader education constituencies is likewise defined and limited by government’s prescribed provisions, systems, rules, regulations, and procedures.
