                                            Activity 1: Write True if the statement is correct and False if it is incorrect. Underline the word/s that makes the statement incorrect. (x2) 1. Financial statements are useful to a person who knows how to interpret the infor- mation contained in the report. 2. When making business decisions, an entrepreneur will need various sources of in- formation and a major source of information is the financial statements. 3. A comparison of information from one period to another is called vertical analysis. 4. An analysis of the interrelationships of information in a single period, expressed as a percentage of a common denominator is called horizontal analysis. 5. Entity A reported inventory balances of 100.00 and 50.00 in 20x1 and 20x0, respec- tively. In a horizontal analysis, a financial statement user would conclude that Entity A's inventory has increased by 50% from 20x0 to 20x1. 6. In 20x1, Entity A reported sales of 100.00 and profit of 20.00. In a vertical analysis, a financial statement user would conclude that Entity A was able to generate 20% profit from every pe- so of its sales during the period. 7. At the beginning of the day, you have 200.00 cash in your pocket. At the end of the day, you have 50.00 left. If you make a horizontal analysis of your pocket, you would conclude that your cash has decreased by 80% during the day. 8. Current ratio is computed as current assets less current liabilities to measure an en- tity's liquidity. 9. The quick ratio is also called acid- test ratio has a similar purpose to that of the cur- rent ratio. Use the following information for the next two (2) questions. Entity B has total current assets of 100,000.00 and a total current liabilities of 25,000.00 10. Entity B's current ratio is 4. 11. Entity B's Working Capital is 125,000.00 12. Short term solvency or liquidity refers to an entity's ability to pay its short term obli gations. 13. Activity ratios provide a measure of how efficient a business is utilizing its resourc 14. Solvency is the ability of the company to measure its operating performance as a return on its investment 15. Debt ratio is a solvency ratio that measures business liabilities as a percentage of total assets and its formula is total liabilities over total assets. Activity 2:​</a>

                            14. Activity 1: Write True if the statement is correct and False if it is incorrect. Underline the word/s that makes the statement incorrect. (x2) 1. Financial statements are useful to a person who knows how to interpret the infor- mation contained in the report. 2. When making business decisions, an entrepreneur will need various sources of in- formation and a major source of information is the financial statements. 3. A comparison of information from one period to another is called vertical analysis. 4. An analysis of the interrelationships of information in a single period, expressed as a percentage of a common denominator is called horizontal analysis. 5. Entity A reported inventory balances of 100.00 and 50.00 in 20x1 and 20x0, respec- tively. In a horizontal analysis, a financial statement user would conclude that Entity A's inventory has increased by 50% from 20x0 to 20x1. 6. In 20x1, Entity A reported sales of 100.00 and profit of 20.00. In a vertical analysis, a financial statement user would conclude that Entity A was able to generate 20% profit from every pe- so of its sales during the period. 7. At the beginning of the day, you have 200.00 cash in your pocket. At the end of the day, you have 50.00 left. If you make a horizontal analysis of your pocket, you would conclude that your cash has decreased by 80% during the day. 8. Current ratio is computed as current assets less current liabilities to measure an en- tity's liquidity. 9. The quick ratio is also called acid- test ratio has a similar purpose to that of the cur- rent ratio. Use the following information for the next two (2) questions. Entity B has total current assets of 100,000.00 and a total current liabilities of 25,000.00 10. Entity B's current ratio is 4. 11. Entity B's Working Capital is 125,000.00 12. Short term solvency or liquidity refers to an entity's ability to pay its short term obli gations. 13. Activity ratios provide a measure of how efficient a business is utilizing its resourc 14. Solvency is the ability of the company to measure its operating performance as a return on its investment 15. Debt ratio is a solvency ratio that measures business liabilities as a percentage of total assets and its formula is total liabilities over total assets. Activity 2:​</h2><br />
