There are several types of convergence. The Continental-continental convergence, Continental-oceanic convergence and oceanic-oceanic convergence. When the convergence is between continental crust and oceanic crust; several geologic features will be formed, namely; volcano, trench and_____.And if the convergence is between two oceanic crusts, then same geologic features will also be formed. However, in the event that the edge of the leading plate will suddenly flick upward,_____might occur which will happen on the surface of the ocean that would result to loss of lives. Moreover, when the convergence is between two continental plates, a series of mountains will be formed which we call_____. While in the divergent type of plate boundary, plates_____ and oceanic ridges and rift valleys will be formed. Finally, on the transform- fault boundary plates slide past each.

The Continental-continental convergence, Continental-oceanic convergence and oceanic-oceanic convergence. When the convergence is between continental crust and oceanic crust; several geologic features will be formed, namely; volcano, trench and And if the convergence is between two oceanic crusts, then same geologic features will also be formed. However, in the event that the edge of the leading plate will suddenly flick upward, might occur which will happen on the surface of the ocean that would result to loss of lives. Moreover, when the convergence is between two continental plates, a series of mountains will be formed which we call While in the divergent type of plate boundary, plates and oceanic ridges and rift valleys will be formed.

                            28. In a convergent type of plate boundary, plates move toward each other. There are several types of convergence. The Continental-continental convergence, Continental-oceanic convergence and oceanic-oceanic convergence. When the convergence is between continental crust and oceanic crust; several geologic features will be formed, namely; volcano, trench and And if the convergence is between two oceanic crusts, then same geologic features will also be formed. However, in the event that the edge of the leading plate will suddenly flick upward, might occur which will happen on the surface of the ocean that would result to loss of lives. Moreover, when the convergence is between two continental plates, a series of mountains will be formed which we call While in the divergent type of plate boundary, plates and oceanic ridges and rift valleys will be formed. Finally, on the transform- fault boundary plates slide past each. No collision and no separation happen between plates,​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Convergent boundaries , where two plates are moving toward each other, are of three types, depending on the type of crust present on either side of the boundary — oceanic or continental . The types are ocean-ocean, ocean-continent, and continent-continent.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana po makatuong ito sayo</p><br />
