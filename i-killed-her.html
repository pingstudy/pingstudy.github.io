 The dead girl, beautiful and peaceful in death, her scarlet lips slightly
parted as though whispering caress to her lover, her blue eyes gentle and
unquestioning as a baby, lay in the murderer’s arms like a child who has
been rocked to sleep. Her golden hair falling in profusion about her
shoulders all but concealed the cruel welt of red about her throat. Te
murderer, clutching his precious burden to him, like a mother holding an
infant, appeared dazed. As the police came in, he rose to meet them, still
carrying his precious burden in his arms. The officers almost had to force
him to relinquish her. He could not answer questions –could merely clutch
her closer to his breast all that remained of the girl he loved better than life,
and mutter, “I love her, I love her,” like a man in a dream. A few hours later
when I saw him in the sordid surroundings of the 10th Precinct Station
House, so different from the cozy cottage which had been abode of a tragic
love, he was till dry-eyed, though his face wore a ghastly pallor.
 But when I tried to question him, I became aware of the terrific strain
under which he suffered and he showed all the signs of a man on the verge
of hysteria. When I tried to draw from him the motive of the pitiful tragedy,
he could only reply, his pale boyish face a mask: “I killed her; but God didn’t
say a word, a word.”
 At last he managed pitifully to say, “I killed her so that she would be mine
alone for always!”
 And this is the irony of fate! Separated as they were by wealth, social
position, and all that it implies, it was only in death that they could be united.
 Who are we to pass judgment on such a love?

                            17. Text 4
 The dead girl, beautiful and peaceful in death, her scarlet lips slightly
parted as though whispering caress to her lover, her blue eyes gentle and
unquestioning as a baby, lay in the murderer’s arms like a child who has
been rocked to sleep. Her golden hair falling in profusion about her
shoulders all but concealed the cruel welt of red about her throat. Te
murderer, clutching his precious burden to him, like a mother holding an
infant, appeared dazed. As the police came in, he rose to meet them, still
carrying his precious burden in his arms. The officers almost had to force
him to relinquish her. He could not answer questions –could merely clutch
her closer to his breast all that remained of the girl he loved better than life,
and mutter, “I love her, I love her,” like a man in a dream. A few hours later
when I saw him in the sordid surroundings of the 10th Precinct Station
House, so different from the cozy cottage which had been abode of a tragic
love, he was till dry-eyed, though his face wore a ghastly pallor.
 But when I tried to question him, I became aware of the terrific strain
under which he suffered and he showed all the signs of a man on the verge
of hysteria. When I tried to draw from him the motive of the pitiful tragedy,
he could only reply, his pale boyish face a mask: “I killed her; but God didn’t
say a word, a word.”
 At last he managed pitifully to say, “I killed her so that she would be mine
alone for always!”
 And this is the irony of fate! Separated as they were by wealth, social
position, and all that it implies, it was only in death that they could be united.
 Who are we to pass judgment on such a love?
