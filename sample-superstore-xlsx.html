                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The practice that you described, in which a company temporarily prices its goods below cost in order to prevent competitors from entering the market and driving them out of business, is known as predatory pricing. Predatory pricing is a form of unfair competition in which a dominant firm intentionally sets prices below its own cost of production in order to drive competitors out of the market. Once the competitors are driven out, the dominant firm can then raise its prices and potentially profit from a lack of competition.</p><p></p><p>Predatory pricing is generally considered to be an unfair trade practice and is prohibited by competition laws in many countries. It can have negative effects on competition and can lead to higher prices for consumers in the long run.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>AnIn organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon.[1]:620 Hydrocarbons are examples of group 14 hydrides. Hydrocarbons from which one hydrogen atom has been removed are functional groups called hydrocarbyls.[2] Hydrocarbons are generally colourless and hydrophobic with only weak odours. Because of their diverse molecular structures, it is difficult to generalize further. Most anthropogenic emissions of hydrocarbons are from the burning of fossil fuels including fuel production and combustion. Natural sources of hydrocarbons such as ethylene, isoprene, and monoterpenes come from the emissions of vegetation.[3]</strong></p><p></p><br />
