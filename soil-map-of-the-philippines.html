It is the agricultural practice of growing single crop year after year on the same land._______4. This activity is necessary so that a map can be drawn of the property‘s topography, boundaries, soils, water resources and so on, and a farm business plan can be formulated._______5. This is a planting system used in sloping or hilly land to avoid soil erosion._______6. It is a system of irrigation that requires a dam to direct the water to a stream._______7. It is an essential feature of a plan where the field shape must be accurately drawn showing pertinent obstructions, features and elevation details._______8. This method of irrigation uses water efficiently and the operation is flexible because the water is applied in the form of a spray or artificial rain. _______9.

How are they used in your community For example What are the uses of sand, gravel, or clay? How are marble stones used? Think of Do you know that the Philippines is listed as the 5th mineral country in the world, 3rd in gold reserves, 4th in cover and sth in nickel! The ores (mineral bearing rocka) are processed out of the country to recover the pure metal The richness of the Philippines in terms of mineral resources is being attributed to its location in the so called Pacific Ring of Fire. The area is associated with over 450 volcances (amall triangles in the map) and is home to approximately 75% of bron filings Quarte Copper ore EXERCISES A Identify the metallic deposits in the Philippines, their location and uses.

The important metalle minerals found in various parts of the Philippines include gold, copper, iron chrome made up of chromium, iron, and other matalal nickel, cobalt, and platinum. The most productive copper and gold cars in the Philippines are found in Baguic, the province of Benguet, and in Surigao Davao areas Major producers of nickel are in Palawan and Surigao (DENR Webane 2012) Metals are important. The properties of metals make them useful for specific purposes You learned these in ter 1 fron is the main maternal for steel bars used in buildings and road construction Copper is used in making al wires Tin is the material for milk cana and other preserved food products. Nicket is mixed with copper or other secals to form stainless cooking wares Gold is important in making jewelry The Philippines has also varied nonmetallic resources including sand and gravel limestone, marble, clay and other quarry materials Your teacher will show you a map of the nometallic deposits in the Philippines Locate your are 1 and determine what nonmetallic deposits are found there How are these deposits recovered? How are they used in your community For example What are the uses of sand, gravel, or clay? How are marble stones used? Think of Do you know that the Philippines is listed as the 5th mineral country in the world, 3rd in gold reserves, 4th in cover and sth in nickel! The ores (mineral bearing rocka) are processed out of the country to recover the pure metal The richness of the Philippines in terms of mineral resources is being attributed to its location in the so called Pacific Ring of Fire. The area is associated with over 450 volcances (amall triangles in the map) and is home to approximately 75% of bron filings Quarte Copper ore EXERCISES A Identify the metallic deposits in the Philippines, their location and uses.
