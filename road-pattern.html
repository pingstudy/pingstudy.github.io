THE ROAD NOT TAKEN 
By Robert Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, ___
And sorry I could not travel both ___
And be one traveler, long I stood ___
And looked down one as far as I could ___
To where it bent in the undergrowth; ___
Then took the other, as just as fair, ___
And having perhaps the better claim, ___
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; ___
Though as for that the passing there ___
Had worn them really about the same, ___
And both that morning equally lay ___
In leaves no step had trodden black. ___
Oh, I kept the first for another day! ___
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, ___
I doubted if I should ever come back. ___ 
I shall be telling this with a sigh ___
Somewhere ages and ages hence: ___
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— ___
I took the one less traveled by, ___
And that has made all the difference. ___

                                            Road accidents happen due to several reasons. One reason is the carelessness of drivers. Some drivers ignore traffic rules and warning signals. They also resist wearing seat belts. Some of them are even drunk while driving. Next reason is the weather conditions. During a hot weather, drivers are prone to have high blood pressure or heat stroke which lead to road accidents. Meanwhile, during rainy seasons when the road is wet or slippery, drivers tend to lose control which lead to vehicular accidents. Another reason is the traffic jam. When there are too many vehicles, some drivers easily panic, get more nervous, and become error-prone. As a result, traffic accidents happen. To sum up, carelessness, weather conditions, and traffic jams are common reasons of road accidents.2. Pattern Used:Educating our children to take care and protect the environment by saving trees is a lifetime mission. It is important for us and our children to understand that trees do so much for our environment. Trees provide us clean air, food, paper, and medicines. They also give shelter to humans and animals. Can you imagine a world without trees? With this, I urge you to join me in making this world a better, greener, cleaner place for our children and the future generations.3.

Now, what can you tell me about the Silk Road? the Silk Road. I can't remember about the Silk Road. Maybe if we think of it like a story. Stories remain in our hearts even when all else is gone. Our people have always told stories from our very beginning when we were a partier, and what I saw on a fractured land in the claws of the Hindu Kush mountains, scorched by the fiery eyes, or the northern deserts, black Rubble, Earth against ice peaks. Our land was the petrified skeleton of a monster. We're Adiana, the land of the noble and honorable. We were a pathway to everywhere, carrying goods from east to west. We studied the stars and began to see order and it's the chaos. We were scientists, philosophers and storytellers. Weston sought answers, and then more questions, we began to see our place in the universe. But we were at the edges of empires at war with each other, as borders were defined and redefined. Over 1000s of years. Of these mighty rulers came side as the great of Persia and Alexander the graves of mastodon. Then came the Mauryan Empire, chinggis Khan, and so on, and so on. Each time there was bloodshed, and each time there were survivors, a pattern repeating itself endlessly. When I was young, Padawan I knew what peace felt like here in this city. Children went to school, and then went to university. All their empires forgot about this for a while, at least.</a>

THE ROAD NOT TAKEN 
By Robert Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, ___
And sorry I could not travel both ___
And be one traveler, long I stood ___
And looked down one as far as I could ___
To where it bent in the undergrowth; ___
Then took the other, as just as fair, ___
And having perhaps the better claim, ___
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; ___
Though as for that the passing there ___
Had worn them really about the same, ___
And both that morning equally lay ___
In leaves no step had trodden black. ___
Oh, I kept the first for another day! ___
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, ___
I doubted if I should ever come back. ___ 
I shall be telling this with a sigh ___
Somewhere ages and ages hence: ___
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— ___
I took the one less traveled by, ___
And that has made all the difference. ___

                            13. Road accidents happen due to several reasons. One reason is the carelessness of drivers. Some drivers ignore traffic rules and warning signals. They also resist wearing seat belts. Some of them are even drunk while driving. Next reason is the weather conditions. During a hot weather, drivers are prone to have high blood pressure or heat stroke which lead to road accidents. Meanwhile, during rainy seasons when the road is wet or slippery, drivers tend to lose control which lead to vehicular accidents. Another reason is the traffic jam. When there are too many vehicles, some drivers easily panic, get more nervous, and become error-prone. As a result, traffic accidents happen. To sum up, carelessness, weather conditions, and traffic jams are common reasons of road accidents.2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Research refers to a logical and systematic search for new and useful information on a certain topic. Specifically, it can be classified into two main types. The first type is the basic research. It deals with the investigation on basic principles and reasons for the occurrence of a certain phenomenon or process. Applied research is another type that solves certain problems through using accepted theories. Also, it tries to explore how things can be changed. These two types of research are used in the academic and scholarly fields.

</p><p>There are many ways to lessen the amount of household wastes. First, turn away from single-use plastics. You can do this by bringing your own reusable containers and ask restaurants to use them in packing your food. Next, use eco-bags when buying in grocery stores. This can minimize the use of plastic cellophanes. Another way is by sorting your garbage. Just get any trash receptacles and follow the proper sorting procedures. Separate plastic bottles and metal wastes from fruits and vegetable scraps. For plastic and metal waste, clean them and place them in separate bins. Once the recyclable bins are filled up, take them to your local recycling centers. These are some of the ways to reduce the amount of wastes.

</p><p>There are those who believe that technology makes us less creative. They strongly claim that cellphones, computers, and other gadgets make us lazy and dependent. Also, they say that we don’t have to think or create for ourselves. However, the truth is these technologies have different features that offer multiple creative outlets. We can edit videos, design webpage, make short films, create graphic arts, and compose web novels. Technology brings out people’s creativity in this new age.

Now, what can you tell me about the Silk Road? the Silk Road. I can't remember about the Silk Road. Maybe if we think of it like a story. Stories remain in our hearts even when all else is gone. Our people have always told stories from our very beginning when we were a partier, and what I saw on a fractured land in the claws of the Hindu Kush mountains, scorched by the fiery eyes, or the northern deserts, black Rubble, Earth against ice peaks. Our land was the petrified skeleton of a monster. We're Adiana, the land of the noble and honorable. We were a pathway to everywhere, carrying goods from east to west. We studied the stars and began to see order and it's the chaos. We were scientists, philosophers and storytellers. Weston sought answers, and then more questions, we began to see our place in the universe. But we were at the edges of empires at war with each other, as borders were defined and redefined. Over 1000s of years. Of these mighty rulers came side as the great of Persia and Alexander the graves of mastodon. Then came the Mauryan Empire, chinggis Khan, and so on, and so on. Each time there was bloodshed, and each time there were survivors, a pattern repeating itself endlessly. When I was young, Padawan I knew what peace felt like here in this city. Children went to school, and then went to university. All their empires forgot about this for a while, at least.</h2><br />
