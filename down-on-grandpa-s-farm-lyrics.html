                                            It was summertime. The children are excited to visit their grandparents in the farm. The children had a sleepless night. They were imagining of the wonderful things they do in the farm. They play and eat in a peaceful meadow near the lake. They sometimes catch fish with the help of grandpa and their cousins. They sometimes swim in the lake with their cousins. Their cousins were helpful to make things easy for them, they were so eager to help in feeding grandpa's animals while grandma is watchful and reminds them to be careful. The children can't wait for another summer to come. They wish they could do these things this summer and for the next summers to come. ​</a>

Multiply both the height and width by two and add the results.</strong></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>100 centimeters equal to 1 meter or one centimeter equal to one-hundredth (i.e. 1/100 th) of meter.</p><br />
