                                            4. Katrina had been starving ever since she was thrown out of the castle. She had not eaten in days. As she walked by the market, the smells of roasting lamb and chicken caused her mouth to fill with saliva. She wondered how much longer she could last without food. A bread wagon rolled past. It swerved suddenly to avoid a child who had ran across the road. As it swerved a small loaf of bread fell from the truck and landed on the dusty ground. The end of the loaf was in a puddle. Katrina looked around and noticed that nobody was watching, then she... What is likely to happen next? Explanation: 5. It was a hot summer day and Kyle had just bought a popsicle from the ice-cream man. As he was about to open the popsicle his mom called him in the house to talk about his progress report. Kyle put the popsicle down on the stoop and went to talk with his mother. Twenty minutes later he came back outside to get his popsicle. Some clouds had moved and now the sealed popsicle was sitting directly in the sun. Kyle picked up the package and... What is likely to happen next?Explanation:​</a>

                                            1. Topic Sentence:
After driving through a stretch of eerie darkness, the mansion at the end of the winding driveway
is an illuminating sight. Lights spotlight the colonial façade and the brick walk leading to an open patio
that fans out into the front door. A leaning tree shelters the edge of the patio. On the right side of the wide
foyer is the edge of the living room, a rectangular expanse under a high ceiling. The dining room runs
parallel to the entire length of the living room. This divides into conversation groupings furniture done in
satin beige and peach with draperies to match. The thick rugs mute footsteps on the black marble floors.

(September 26, 1987)
2. Topic Sentence:
Proclaiming Ninoy a hero does not guarantee that the race will remember. But it should help. It
should help that, as a hero, his life and deed are engraved in textbooks, relived in skits and songs,
and taught in school. We need only to recall again the letter Jesus Luis de Leon-Borbon wrote here
last month to see how vital-no, how desperate this undertaking is. De Leon, a half-Spaniard, was
looking at the statue of Isidro Torres in Malolos when a group of kids came over and began wondering
who Torres was. Surprised, De Leon volunteered that Torres was a hero who fought by the side of
Gregorio del Pilar. "This del Pilar," said one of the kids, "is he also one of our heroes?"
-Conrado de Quiros, "Hero Worship" in There's the Rub, Philippine Daily Inquirer
(August 20, 1993)
3. Topic Sentence:
When she was teaching, she would relish the weekends for the endless tasks which she found to be
done in her home. Clothes sorted, darned, set aside for renovation, and she, in close company with the
sewing woman whom she hired for the day. The closets had to be cleared, the plants to be inspected, the
unhealthy and the dying to be made well again, the lush and the flowering to be enjoyed. The kitchen to
be given the week's check-up, marketing, children and husband to be fussed over, enjoyed.

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

                            8. 1. Topic Sentence:
After driving through a stretch of eerie darkness, the mansion at the end of the winding driveway
is an illuminating sight. Lights spotlight the colonial façade and the brick walk leading to an open patio
that fans out into the front door. A leaning tree shelters the edge of the patio. On the right side of the wide
foyer is the edge of the living room, a rectangular expanse under a high ceiling. The dining room runs
parallel to the entire length of the living room. This divides into conversation groupings furniture done in
satin beige and peach with draperies to match. The thick rugs mute footsteps on the black marble floors.

2. Topic Sentence:
Proclaiming Ninoy a hero does not guarantee that the race will remember. But it should help. It
should help that, as a hero, his life and deed are engraved in textbooks, relived in skits and songs,
and taught in school. We need only to recall again the letter Jesus Luis de Leon-Borbon wrote here
last month to see how vital-no, how desperate this undertaking is. De Leon, a half-Spaniard, was
looking at the statue of Isidro Torres in Malolos when a group of kids came over and began wondering
who Torres was. Surprised, De Leon volunteered that Torres was a hero who fought by the side of
Gregorio del Pilar. "This del Pilar," said one of the kids, "is he also one of our heroes?"

When she was teaching, she would relish the weekends for the endless tasks which she found to be

Surprised, De Leon volunteered that Torres was a hero who fought by the side of Gregorio del Pillar. “This del Pilar” said one of the kids, “ is he also one of the heroes?”Conrado de Quiros, “Hero Worship” in There’s the Rub, Philippine Daily Inquiry( August 20, 1993)	Topic Sentence: __________________________________________________3.When she was teaching, she would relish the weekends for the endless tasks which she found to be done in her home.

The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />

Write the answers on a one whole sheet of paper. Identify the Pattern of Development used in the thesis statements. 1. Teeth bleaching can be done in five simple steps. 2. All provincial buses should not be allowed to pass through EDSA. 3. iPhone 6 has many features that make it stand out in the market. 4. There are many reasons why unemployment continues to increase. 5. Drinking cough syrup may lead to various side effects. Identify the pattern of development in each paragraph. 6. To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />
