On impact, both drivers lock their brakes. The SUV and car stick together and travel a distance of 8.2 m before they come to a stop. A. Which of the two cars incurred greater damage? Give possible reasons for such conditions. B. How is conservation of momentum relevant to your safety either as pedestrians or as motorists?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. A. The <strong>car</strong>, <strong>because the SUV has greater momentum and thus packs bigger impacts, whereas the car has less</strong>. The <strong>car also can be less durable than a SUV,</strong> making it a good reason to have more damage.        </p><p>   B. Conservation <strong>is relevant as a safety measure, inertia is dangerous and kills, but a simple seatbelt can save lives</strong>.</p><p></p><p>2. No, because a r<strong>efrigerator barely makes any heat</strong> even if the compressor is running a lot, and also <strong>produces much more cold, so it should be a cold engine.</strong></p><p></p><p>3. My knowledge of c<strong>onservation of energy is important especially when in sports activities, this helps me conserve stamina </strong>and thus do more activities even when I am physically disabled.
