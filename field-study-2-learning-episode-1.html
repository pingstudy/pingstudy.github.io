                            5. easy in our discussion for episode 2 what have you learn about academic language​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Academic language is the language needed by students to do the work in schools. It includes, for example, discipline-specific vocabulary, grammar and punctuation, and applications of rhetorical conventions and devices that are typical for a content area (e.g., essays, lab reports, discussions of a controversial issue.) One of your goals for the learning segment should be to further develop your students’ academic language abilities. This means that your learning objectives should focus on language as well as on content. You can and should communicate content through means other than language, e.g., physical models, visuals, demonstrations. However, you should also develop your students’ abilities to produce and understand oral and written texts typical in your subject area as well as to engage in language-based tasks.</p><br />

This will compel the students to brainstorm and analyze. Examples of affective activities include asking students for their opinion, having them work in a group or making them self-reflect. Psychomotor activities include engaging them in a physical game or going on a field trip.<br /><br /><br />

                        "Enhancing a Face to Face Learning Environment"<p>A field study for future teachers. Here are the content of the episode.</p><p></p><p><strong>Can you participate in and provide assistance in a face-to-face learning situation given the concepts and the infographic?</strong></p><p></p><p>As a future teacher, I may take part in and <strong>contribute to a face-to-face learning environment </strong>by creating a<strong> welcoming, comfortable, and conducive classroom</strong> where students feel free to participate in class and ask questions. </p><p></p><p>Students are encouraged to <strong>connect with one another, express their ideas, and give comments on material or lessons.</strong> In order to improve the quality of the assignment output, I will also let students work both independently and in groups to strengthen their <strong>social, creative, and analytical thinking abilities.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>In addition, I think I will be able to use a ra<strong>nge of teaching techniques that will greatly benefit and aid in a face-to-face learning</strong> setting because we are using this new curriculum. I think I can use technology to make my classes more<strong> interesting for my students and to inspire them to consider and discuss what they have learned.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>What, in your opinion, has changed about the current face-to-face learning environment?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>I think that the use of technology in the classroom</strong>, which creates productive learning environments, is causing changes in the face-to-face learning environment. There are locations that <strong>must be reserved, among other things, and it affects how chairs and tables are set up.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Choose one of the modifications you identified that you can implement. What method will you use?</strong></p><p></p><p> The <strong>overall design of the classroom</strong> is where I think I can make the biggest improvements, and I<strong> intend to use the existing technologies to make my classroom more innovative</strong>. I think my priorities should be removing distractions from the classroom and promoting student growth.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Describe the physical environment</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The<strong> total structure and arrangement of a particular classroom</strong> and its learning centers is referred to as the physical environment. To increase learning possibilities and engagement for all students, teachers should arrange the<strong> room, furniture, and resources in the classroom. </strong></p><p></p><p>The <strong>Universal Design for Learning principle</strong>, which emphasizes that the environment and the resources included in it should be accessible to all, can be used by i<strong>nstructors to do this in an efficient manner. </strong></p><p></p><p>This accessibility may be made possible by <strong>offering books at various reading levels, setting up supplies on a shelf</strong> within easy reach, or leaving enough room in the classroom for a student using a wheelchair.</p><p></p><p><strong>Describe the psychological environment </strong></p><p></p><p>It is safe to say that the psychological environment is the most challenging and biased. Within the psychological environment, teachers show their <strong>attitudes, excitement, values, and principles. </strong></p><p></p><p>The majority of students anticipate support and encouragement when they start their educational path. The psychological climate in the classroom encourages discussion of <strong>ideas, attitudes, and behaviors as well as raising queries and looking into potential problems.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Describe the classroom's social environment </strong></p><p></p><p>A classroom's social environment is how it affects or facilitates relationships between young students, teachers, and parents. An environment that is <strong>well-designed for social interaction promotes pleasant interactions between adults and children</strong> and enables adults to assist youngsters in achieving their social objectives. </p><p></p><p>In order to establish a classroom climate that<strong> encourages positive social connections,</strong> teachers must organize activities that take the following considerations into mind.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn more about face to face class:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19551923</p><p></p><p>Read more about field study related:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/18998097</p><p></p><p></p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
