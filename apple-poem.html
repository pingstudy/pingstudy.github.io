                                            A Poison Tree BY WILLIAM BLAKE I was angry with my friend; I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow. And I waterd it in fears, Night &amp; morning with my tears: And I sunned it with smiles, And with soft deceitful wiles. And it grew both day and night. Till it bore an apple bright. And my foe beheld it shine, And he knew that it was mine. And into my garden stole, When the night had veild the pole; In the morning glad I see; My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

                                            1. “Chicago”
In "Chicago," Carl Sandburg describes the city as a "bold slugger," "a savage," a "young man," and "an ignorant fighter." What do all these descriptions have in common? How do they relate to Chicago as a rapidly growing city at the start of the twentieth century? 
2. “Grass”
As Carl Sandburg's "Grass" ends, the grass again calls to be allowed to work. As readers see in the poem, the work of the grass is to cover the evidence of the tragic events that happen on battlefields so that people no longer recognize these places as battlefields. Is the work of the grass positive or negative? Why? What does it mean that the poem ends with the grass repeating its demand to be allowed to work?
3. “The Road Not Taken”
Consider the ambiguity of the poem's final line. The speaker imagines himself in the future stating that his decision to take the road less traveled has made all the difference. Is this necessarily a positive statement or an endorsement of his choice? How might the speaker's statement be interpreted as less than positive? 
4. “After Apple Picking”
At the conclusion of "After Apple-Picking," the speaker is thinking about his upcoming sleep and wondering if it will be like the hibernation of the woodchuck or "just some human sleep." What is one possible symbolic interpretation of the speaker's sleep? How does interpreting the speaker's sleep as a symbol change the meaning of the rest of the poem?</a>

                        <p></p><p>In the small and poor home behind a portion of the Intramuros walls. There are two wooden boxes on either side of the doorway. At left is an Acacia tree with a wooden bench under it. It is where the poor family lived in, and where the story starts on how life was going on and end in the complexity of life in which the main character lived with no choice but to go back again with his old ways of life.Mario- He is the Father of the story, the husband of Gloria. He is known to be bad before but he strive hard to change his life for her daughter and for her wife, but life sometimes is unfair that force him with no choice to go back the old way of his life.</p><p>Gloria- She is the wife of Mario. The very good and lovable woman who just want a simple life yet descent life. She is the reason why Mario changed because of her unconditional love to him.</p><p>Pablo- The evil man in the story, the protagonist, the old friend of Mario. He wants easy and dishonest money, the life that Mario lived before.This is a story of how wrong decisions become greater burdens to a family. Mario’s family happens to be in the lower bracket of society. When Mario got home, Gloria saw Mario and she was asking for some money to feed their children to Mario. Mario said that he have no money because he did something.</p><p>Gloria didn’t believe on what Mario said and said to tell the truth. When Mario answered it, Gloria was shocked on what she heard because Mario lost his job. Gloria asked Mario if how he lost his job and Mario answered it and Gloria was shocked again because Mario said that he lost his job because of an apple.</p><p>Gloria said that how can he lose his job by just taking one not a dozen not a crate but one apple and Mario answered that he just saw it rolling and he found himself putting it in his bag because Tita would love to have it, and Mario told Gloria that there’s no need to worry because he found a new job.</p><p>Suddenly Pablo was there ruining the whole conversation and asked them if how is there daughter doing and he’ll loan a few pesos to help their daughter and Gloria said that no thank you because Mario stopped depending on Pablo. Pablo said that Mario’s new job was with Pablo. When Gloria heard it he told Mario that it’s a bad doing and risky.</p><p>Mario didn’t listen and walks away with Pablo and told Gloria not to worry because he will come back early morning and don’t wait for him. Gloria cries and shouting Mario, while Tita was crying also because he heard the conversation.The mood of the story is serious. It tackles many aspects of human flaws and what is wrong in the culture. The story is sometimes sad but in the end, there’s a glimpse of hopefulness even though it is in vain.Mario: Why? Did God create apple trees to bear fruit for the rich alone? Didn’t He create the whole world for everyone? That’s why I tried to bring the apple home for Tita. When we brought her into this world, we promised her everything. She has the right to have everything in life.</p><p>Gloria: So, for just an apple, you lost a job you need so much?</p><br />

                        <br /><br />It seems that the poem "Barbara Freitchie" describes Frederick as being in a valley, surrounded by hills and mountains. The description of the valley as being "green-walled by the hill of Maryland" and having apple and peach trees suggests that it is a fertile and beautiful place, "fair a the garden of the Lord." The mention of the mountain winding down into town suggests that the valley is located at the base of the mountain, possibly with a river or stream running through it.<br />

                            14. 1. “Chicago”
In "Chicago," Carl Sandburg describes the city as a "bold slugger," "a savage," a "young man," and "an ignorant fighter." What do all these descriptions have in common? How do they relate to Chicago as a rapidly growing city at the start of the twentieth century? 
2. “Grass”
As Carl Sandburg's "Grass" ends, the grass again calls to be allowed to work. As readers see in the poem, the work of the grass is to cover the evidence of the tragic events that happen on battlefields so that people no longer recognize these places as battlefields. Is the work of the grass positive or negative? Why? What does it mean that the poem ends with the grass repeating its demand to be allowed to work?
3. “The Road Not Taken”
Consider the ambiguity of the poem's final line. The speaker imagines himself in the future stating that his decision to take the road less traveled has made all the difference. Is this necessarily a positive statement or an endorsement of his choice? How might the speaker's statement be interpreted as less than positive? 
4. “After Apple Picking”
At the conclusion of "After Apple-Picking," the speaker is thinking about his upcoming sleep and wondering if it will be like the hibernation of the woodchuck or "just some human sleep." What is one possible symbolic interpretation of the speaker's sleep? How does interpreting the speaker's sleep as a symbol change the meaning of the rest of the poem?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Story Analysis</strong></p><p><strong>1. Chicago</strong></p><p>Bold slugger, a savage, a young man, and an ignorant fighter are descriptions of people living in one country particularly in Chicago. Some people of Chicago are like bold slugger since they can be as tough as their punches. They are those who are well adjusted and can be very tough. The second group are like savages who are like monsters. They are the ones who uses their masculinity just to undermine others. There are also groups of people that are like young men who seem too innocent. And the last group are like  ignorant fighters who do not know how to fight and where to begin. Chicago was once like these groups of people during the twentieth century. The city was filled with different groups of people just like them who have different ways of approaching life challenges.</p><p><strong>2. Grass</strong></p><p>The work of the grass can be both positive and negative. Covering the evidence of tragic events that happen on battlefields so that people will no longer recognize these places as battlefields can be a positive work since the grass do not want people to dwell on the negative things that have happened. They want people to recover at once and be not affected with the tragedy that have happened. On the contrary, the work of the grass can also be negative since it does not allow people to at least mourn for their deads and they do not want them to have a recollection of their past. The poem ends with the grass repeating its demand to be allowed to work only means that the grass work begins when lives end and it will be repeatedly done over and over again.</p><p><strong>3. Road Not Taken</strong></p><p>The last two lines of the poem are simply an endorsement of the author's choice. However, it can also be interpreted as less than positive since it can be sensed as a form of regret for not choosing the road that he thinks is best for him.</p><p><strong>4. After Apple Picking</strong></p><p>The speaker's sleep might be interpreted as a moment of silence and thinking. It is just like having a break after a very tiring work or a long day. Interpreting it this way will make the poem to be more meaningful since it implies that whatever are nature of work are we need to have some sort of rest in order to rearrange things and see if there are still works to be done or accomplished. </p><br />

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Bumboat Cruise on the Singapore River by  Miriam Wei Wei Lo

Rhetoric is what keeps this island afloat.
Singaporean voice with a strong American accent,
barely audible above the drone of the bumboat engine:
“Singaporeans are crazy about their food.
They are especially fond of all-you-can-eat buffets.
Why not do as the locals do and try out one of the buffets
at these hotels along the waterfront.” The Swissotel looms.
The Grand Copthorne. The Miramar. All glass
and upward-sweeping architecture. Why not do
as the locals do. Here in this city where conspicuous consumption
is an artform. Where white tourists wearing slippers and singlets
are tolerated in black-tie establishments. Dollars. Sense.

 How did I ever live in this place? Sixteen years of my life
afloat in this sea of contradictions, of which I was, equally, one;
half-white, half-Chinese; the taxi-driver cannot decide
if I am a tourist or a local, so he pitches at my husband:
“Everything in Singapore is changing all the time.”
Strong gestures. Manic conviction. “This is good.
We are never bored. Sometimes my customers
ask me to take them to a destination, but it is no longer there.”  Strong gestures. Manic conviction. “This is good.
We are never bored. Sometimes my customers
ask me to take them to a destination, but it is no longer there.”
We tighten our grip on two squirming children and pray
that the bumboat tour will exist. Nothing short of a miracle
this small wooden boat which is taking us now past Boat Quay,
in its current incarnation, past the Fullerton Hotel
<p>
</p>To the mouth of the Singapore river, where the Merlion
still astonishes: grotesque and beautiful as a gargoyle.
The children begin to chafe at confinement. My daughter wails
above the drone of the engine. There’s talk of closing the mouth
of the river. New water supply. There’s talk of a casino.
Heated debate in the Cabinet. Old Lee and Young Lee
locked in some Oedipal battle. The swell is bigger out here
in the harbour, slapping up spray against the sides of the boat,
as if it were waves that kept it afloat, this boat,
this island, caught between sinking and swimming,
as I am caught now. As if rhetoric mattered.
As if this place gives me a name for myself.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>SANA PO MAKA TULONG<br />
