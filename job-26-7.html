                                            Does God Really Care About Us?WHY THE QUESTION ARISES: We live in a world full of cruelty and injustice. Many religions teach that the sufferings we experience are God’s will.WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: God never causes what is wicked. “It is unthinkable for the true God to act wickedly, for the Almighty to do wrong!” says Job 34:10. God has a loving purpose for humans. That is why Jesus taught us to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let . . . your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.” (Matthew 6:9, 10) God cares so deeply about us that he has gone to great lengths to make the fulfillment of his purpose a certainty.​—John 3:16.See also Genesis 1:26-28; James 1:13; and 1 Peter 5:6, 7.​</a>

Many religions teach that the sufferings we experience are God’s will.WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: God never causes what is wicked. “It is unthinkable for the true God to act wickedly, for the Almighty to do wrong!” says Job 34:10. God has a loving purpose for humans. That is why Jesus taught us to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let . . . your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.” (Matthew 6:9, 10) God cares so deeply about us that he has gone to great lengths to make the fulfillment of his purpose a certainty.​—John 3:16.See also Genesis 1:26-28; James 1:13; and 1 Peter 5:6, 7.​</h2><br />
