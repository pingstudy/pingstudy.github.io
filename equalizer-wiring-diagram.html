The point at which light rays converge after passing through a convex lens is the principal axis. 3. The process by which screws become magnets is called magnetic induction.​ 4. A concave lens will always produce a virtual, upright, smaller image. 5. A device that measures small amount of current is a galvanometer. 6. An image formed with a lens that can be projected onto a screen is called a real image. 7. Domain is the generic term for a coil of wire used as an electromagnet. 8. When light passes through a concave lens, it diverge, or spread apart. 9. In unmagnetized steel, groups of atoms called domain line up in different directions. 10.A concave lens is also called converging lens because the light that passes through it tends to converge at the focus. 11. Magnetic field lines are lines of force running from the North end to the South end of a magnet. 12. A lens is transparent material made of glass or plastic that refracts light rays and focuses them at a point. 13. The space around a magnet is called its electric field. 14. A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects. 15. A magnet is strongest at the poles. 16. When a ray of light travels from a vacuum to a denser medium such as glass, it is refracted away from the normal.​​​​ 17. When two magnets attract, they push apart. 18. The bending of a ray of light as it travels from one medium to another is called refraction. 19. A steel cabinet is not attracted to a magnet. 20. When light travels from a vacuum into a glass block, its speed decreases. 21. Gravity is a force where objects are attracted or repelled to one another. 22. If an object in air is viewed from beneath the surface of water below, the object appears to be above its true position.​​​​ 23. The first naturally occurring magnetic rock is lodestone. 24. A student placed a pencil in a cup of water. The pencil appears broken because light bends when it passes through water.​​ 25 A wave is a disturbance that travels through a medium from one place to another. 26. Light rays directed to the vertex reflects at equal angle from the principal axis is one of the principal rays to draw when creating a ray diagram for concave mirror. 27. Electromagnetic wave is not capable of transmitting its energy without a medium. 28. The type of mirror dentists usually use to clearly see the images of our teeth is a concave mirror. 29. In a transverse wave, the motion of the particles is parallel to the waves’ direction of propagation.​ 30. P-F Ray states that ray of light parallel to the principal axis, is reflected passing through the principal focus. 31. The speed of a wave with a wavelength of 0.02 m and a frequency of 50 Hz is 5 m/s. 32. The kind of mirror used by department store to give a wider area and smaller image of the shoppers is convex. 33. Crest is the highest point of a wave. 34. Images formed in a curved mirror can be located and described through ray diagramming. 35. A region in a longitudinal wave where the particles are closest together is compression. 36. A convex mirror is called diverging mirror because the parallel incident rays diverge after reflection. 37. EM Spectrum is a continuum of electromagnetic waves arranged according to frequency and wavelength. 38.Center of curvature is the center of the sphere of which the mirror is part. Its distance from the mirror is known as the radius. 39. If you stand 1.0 m in front of a plane mirror, the distance of your image from you would be 2.0 m. 40. The band of the electromagnetic spectrum that helps humans produce vitamin D is gamma ray.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:<br /></strong>1.In a flashlight, when the switch is turned on to complete an electric circuit, the mobile conduction electrons already in the wires and the filament begin to drift through the circuit.<br />2.There must be a complete circuit with no gaps.</p><p>3.If one bulb burns out in a series circuit, then this will break the circuit. This is because every device in a series circuit must work properly for the circuit to be complete. Unlike in a parallel circuit - where each light has its own circuit - so even if one bulb burns out, the remaining bulbs will still function.</p><p>4. A break in any one path does not interrupt the flow of current in the other paths.

                        A simple circuit comprises only the three fundamental components required for an electric circuit to work. A voltage source, a conductive channel, and a resistor are the three fundamental components.a conductive "path," such as wire, or printed etches on a circuit board; a "source" of electrical power, such as a battery or household wall outlet, and, a "load" that needs electrical power to operate, such as a lamp.It makes it easier to understand how to build a particular circuit. We use symbols for the components in circuit diagrams because it's quicker and requires less artistic skill.---a. CurrentAdding extra resistors to a series circuit raises total resistance and consequently reduces the current. In a parallel circuit, however, the converse is true since putting additional resistors in parallel increases the number of options while decreasing resistance values. The current will rise if the same supply is connected to the resistor.all of the above.all of the above.not sure.all of the above.<br />
