                                            Pretend to be a drop of blood travelling through the vessels of the body in a complete circulation. Your journey begins in the capillaries of the lungs, and you just pick up your first load of oxygen. Be sure to name the cells in the lungs that drop off oxygen. Also, name the cells in the blood that pick up the oxygen. Describe where the cells of the blood travel to drop off oxygen. Then describe where these cells of the blood travel to drop off oxygen they have picked up and what they pick up in return. Be sure to give the name for this process. Continue your story by explaining where this new cargo must be dropped off and why. Then, pretend the human body you are inside begins to exercise and energy demand is increased. Explain how your movements change as you try to help maintain homeostasis or balance. Extra Credit #1 - Be creative: Come up with a name for yourself and something that will make your story unique and fun to read! Extra Credit #2: Include drawings. Draw a diagram (like a map or something like that) or make believe you took pictures on your journey.​</a>

A radio wave is generated through vibrating electric current in a _ (1) which travel through the _ (2). It is then detected by the _(3) and picks up the waves and converts them into alternating current with the same _ (4) as the radio waves. A/an _ (5) allows a radio transmitter to send energy into space and a receiver to pick up energy from space. A receiver is usually a _ or _(6,7).
Radio waves cannot be _ OR _(8) but when they reach a _(9), they are converted into sound or _(10).</a>

The Right Atrium (A), which is the THE PATH OF BLOOD upper chamber of the right side of the haart, receives blood from the upper body through the Superior Vena Cava (B) and from the lower body through the Inferior Veno Cava (C). This blood is blue in color because it is returning from the body carrying CO2 (waste from the cells) that was released by body cells as the blood deposited oxygen 2. Blood then flows through the H Tricuspid Valve (D) into the Right Ventricle (E), which is the lower chamber on the right side of the heart. 3. Through contraction of the night ventricle, the blue blood is forced through the Pulmonary Valve (F) into the Pulmonary Artery (G). The Pulmonary Artery (G) branches to both the night and the left lung to pick up oxygen and release carbon dioxide wastes. (On the diagram on the riont, lader these parts on your heart in pencil and color them blue) 4. While in the lungs, the blood changes color to a bright red because it is now full of fresh oxygen needed by the body. It returns from both lungs through the Pulmonary Veins (H). 5. The red blood carrying oxygen for all body cells will now re-enter the left upper chamber of the heart, the Left Atrium (1). It then flows through the Mitral Valve (J) and into the lower left chamber, the Left Ventricle (K). 6. Finally, the oxygenated blood passes through the Aortic Valve (L) into the Aorta (M), the largest artery, where it is sent to all parts of the body.

Instructions: Read the Summary of Makato and the Cowrie Shell, and answer the comprehension check that follows. Complete the information using Venn Diagram. Makato and the Cowrie Shell (summary) SupanneeKhanchanathiti A young boy named Makato was an orphan, and didn't have any way to support himself, so he worked hard doing whatever jobs that he could to survive. Makato was a very hard worker, and people noticed that. He would dream of going on an adventure to a bigger place where the land was fertile and the people were kind, and he was encouraged to do that. One day, when he had prepared enough, he set out. It took him a month to get to the bigger town, and when he arrived he asked a woman for water. He told her that he had come such a long way because he wanted to see the king, who he had heard was kind. He worked with the king's elephants and he started working for her. After some time working, he did encounter the king, and during the encounter he picked up a cowrie shell that was lying on the road and offered it to the king (Cowrie shells were used for money, but just one was practically worthless). When Makato offered the shell to the King, the King said he could keep it, and so Makato pondered what he could do to honor the king's gift. He saw some lettuce seeds at a stall in the market and thought that he could grow them. He asked the woman about them, and she let him have as many as would stick to his finger in return for his treasured cowrie shell. He grew the lettuces, and next time he saw the king, he gave one to him, telling him he grew them from the shell the king had given him. The king was impressed, gave him a job in the castle, and he eventually grew up and married the daughter of the king.   Comprehension Check: Who are the main characters in the story? What is Makatos dream for his future? How did Makato impress the king? What is the moral of the story? Now, let us compare Makatos success to your own example of success using​</a>

1.as the blood reaches capillaries that cover air sacs, exchange of gas happens. The capillaries take off oxygen and give off carbon dioxide. then it will become oxygenated blood.
2. The oxygenated blood is carried back to the left atrium by the pulmonary vein.
3. when the right atrium is filled with blood it contracts and pushes the blood to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve.
4. The deoxygenated blood coming from the different organs and tissues passes through vena cava, both superior and inferior.
5.When the right ventricle contracts it pushes the blood to go to the lungs passing through the pulmonary arteries.
6. this arteries is connected to the capillaries where the exchange of gas happen between blood and cell,
The capillaries release the oxygen from the blood and picks up waste material from the cell, thus it will become deoxygenated blood.
7. then it will return to the heart through veins. then the process begins again.
8. The left ventricles pumps the blood and pushes the oxygenated blood into the aorta.
9. the aorta, branches into arteries and subdivided into arterioles this artery transports oxygenated blood to all parts of the body except for the lungs.
10. when the left atrium receives the oxygenated blood, it contracts and pushes the blood into the left ventricle.
11.It conveys the blood into the heart where it is received by the right atrium.</a>

Write your answer on the box provided.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Pardoner’s Taleby: Geoffrey ChaucerThe Pardoner describes a group of young Flemish people who spend their time drinking and reveling, indulging in all forms of excess. After commenting on their lifestyle of debauchery, the Pardoner enters into a tirade against the vices that they practice. First and foremost is gluttony, which he identifies as the sin that first caused the fall of mankind in Eden. Next, he attacks drunkenness, which makes a man seem mad and witless. Next is gambling, the temptation that ruins men of power and wealth. Finally, he denounces swearing. He argues that it so offends God that he forbade swearing in the Second Commandment—placing it higher up on the list than homicide. After almost two hundred lines of sermonizing, the Pardoner finally returns to his story of the lecherous Flemish youngsters.	As three of these rioters sit drinking, they hear a funeral knell. One of the reveler’s servants tells the group that an old friend of theirs was slain that very night by a mysterious figure named Death. The rioters are outraged and, in their drunkenness, decide to find and kill Death to avenge their friend. Traveling down the road, they meet an old man who appears sorrowful. He says his sorrow stems from old age—he has been waiting for Death to come and take him for some time, and he has wandered all over the world. The youths, hearing the name of Death, demand to know where they can find him. The old man directs them into a grove, where he says he just left Death under an oak tree. The rioters rush to the tree, underneath which they find not Death but eight bushels of gold coins with no owner in sight.	At first, they are speechless, but, then, the youngest of the three reminds them that if they carry the gold into town in daylight, they will be taken for thieves. They must transport the gold under cover of night, and so someone must run into town to fetch bread and wine in the meantime. They draw lots, and the youngest of the three loses and runs off toward town. As soon as he is gone, the sly plotter turns to his friend and divulges his plan: when their friend returns from town, they will kill him and therefore receive greater shares of the wealth. The second rioter agrees, and they prepare their trap. Back in town, the youngest vagrant is having similar thoughts. He could easily be the richest man in town, he realizes, if he could have all the gold to himself. He goes to the apothecary and buys the strongest poison available, then puts the poison into two bottles of wine, leaving a third bottle pure for himself. He returns to the tree, but the other two rioters leap out and kill him.	They sit down to drink their friend’s wine and celebrate, but each happens to pick up a poisoned bottle. Within minutes, they lie dead next to their friend. Thus, concludes the Pardoner, all must beware the sin of avarice, which can only bring treachery and death. He realizes that he has forgotten something: he has relics and pardons in his bag. According to his custom, he tells the pilgrims the value of his relics and asks for contributions—even though he has just told them the relics are fake. He offers the Host the first chance to come forth and kiss the relics, since the Host is clearly the most enveloped in sin. The Host is outraged and proposes to make a relic out of the Pardoner’s genitals, but the Knight calms everybody down. The Host and Pardoner kiss and make up, and all have a good laugh as they continue on their way.​</a>

The Right Atrium (A), which is the THE PATH OF BLOOD upper chamber of the right side of the haart, receives blood from the upper body through the Superior Vena Cava (B) and from the lower body through the Inferior Veno Cava (C). This blood is blue in color because it is returning from the body carrying CO2 (waste from the cells) that was released by body cells as the blood deposited oxygen 2. Blood then flows through the H Tricuspid Valve (D) into the Right Ventricle (E), which is the lower chamber on the right side of the heart. 3. Through contraction of the night ventricle, the blue blood is forced through the Pulmonary Valve (F) into the Pulmonary Artery (G). The Pulmonary Artery (G) branches to both the night and the left lung to pick up oxygen and release carbon dioxide wastes. (On the diagram on the riont, lader these parts on your heart in pencil and color them blue) 4. While in the lungs, the blood changes color to a bright red because it is now full of fresh oxygen needed by the body. It returns from both lungs through the Pulmonary Veins (H). 5. The red blood carrying oxygen for all body cells will now re-enter the left upper chamber of the heart, the Left Atrium (1). It then flows through the Mitral Valve (J) and into the lower left chamber, the Left Ventricle (K). 6. Finally, the oxygenated blood passes through the Aortic Valve (L) into the Aorta (M), the largest artery, where it is sent to all parts of the body.

Makato and the Cowrie Shell (summary) SupanneeKhanchanathiti A young boy named Makato was an orphan, and didn't have any way to support himself, so he worked hard doing whatever jobs that he could to survive. Makato was a very hard worker, and people noticed that. He would dream of going on an adventure to a bigger place where the land was fertile and the people were kind, and he was encouraged to do that. One day, when he had prepared enough, he set out. It took him a month to get to the bigger town, and when he arrived he asked a woman for water. He told her that he had come such a long way because he wanted to see the king, who he had heard was kind. He worked with the king's elephants and he started working for her. After some time working, he did encounter the king, and during the encounter he picked up a cowrie shell that was lying on the road and offered it to the king (Cowrie shells were used for money, but just one was practically worthless). When Makato offered the shell to the King, the King said he could keep it, and so Makato pondered what he could do to honor the king's gift. He saw some lettuce seeds at a stall in the market and thought that he could grow them. He asked the woman about them, and she let him have as many as would stick to his finger in return for his treasured cowrie shell. He grew the lettuces, and next time he saw the king, he gave one to him, telling him he grew them from the shell the king had given him. The king was impressed, gave him a job in the castle, and he eventually grew up and married the daughter of the king.   Comprehension Check: Who are the main characters in the story?

1.as the blood reaches capillaries that cover air sacs, exchange of gas happens. The capillaries take off oxygen and give off carbon dioxide. then it will become oxygenated blood.
2. The oxygenated blood is carried back to the left atrium by the pulmonary vein.
3. when the right atrium is filled with blood it contracts and pushes the blood to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve.
4. The deoxygenated blood coming from the different organs and tissues passes through vena cava, both superior and inferior.
5.When the right ventricle contracts it pushes the blood to go to the lungs passing through the pulmonary arteries.
6. this arteries is connected to the capillaries where the exchange of gas happen between blood and cell,
The capillaries release the oxygen from the blood and picks up waste material from the cell, thus it will become deoxygenated blood.
7. then it will return to the heart through veins. then the process begins again.
8. The left ventricles pumps the blood and pushes the oxygenated blood into the aorta.
9. the aorta, branches into arteries and subdivided into arterioles this artery transports oxygenated blood to all parts of the body except for the lungs.
10. when the left atrium receives the oxygenated blood, it contracts and pushes the blood into the left ventricle.
11.It conveys the blood into the heart where it is received by the right atrium.</h2><br />

                            20. Accomplish the plot diagram following the 5 elements of the story plot from The Pardoner’s Tale. Write your answer on the box provided.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Pardoner’s Taleby: Geoffrey ChaucerThe Pardoner describes a group of young Flemish people who spend their time drinking and reveling, indulging in all forms of excess. After commenting on their lifestyle of debauchery, the Pardoner enters into a tirade against the vices that they practice. First and foremost is gluttony, which he identifies as the sin that first caused the fall of mankind in Eden. Next, he attacks drunkenness, which makes a man seem mad and witless. Next is gambling, the temptation that ruins men of power and wealth. Finally, he denounces swearing. He argues that it so offends God that he forbade swearing in the Second Commandment—placing it higher up on the list than homicide. After almost two hundred lines of sermonizing, the Pardoner finally returns to his story of the lecherous Flemish youngsters.	As three of these rioters sit drinking, they hear a funeral knell. One of the reveler’s servants tells the group that an old friend of theirs was slain that very night by a mysterious figure named Death. The rioters are outraged and, in their drunkenness, decide to find and kill Death to avenge their friend. Traveling down the road, they meet an old man who appears sorrowful. He says his sorrow stems from old age—he has been waiting for Death to come and take him for some time, and he has wandered all over the world. The youths, hearing the name of Death, demand to know where they can find him. The old man directs them into a grove, where he says he just left Death under an oak tree. The rioters rush to the tree, underneath which they find not Death but eight bushels of gold coins with no owner in sight.	At first, they are speechless, but, then, the youngest of the three reminds them that if they carry the gold into town in daylight, they will be taken for thieves. They must transport the gold under cover of night, and so someone must run into town to fetch bread and wine in the meantime. They draw lots, and the youngest of the three loses and runs off toward town. As soon as he is gone, the sly plotter turns to his friend and divulges his plan: when their friend returns from town, they will kill him and therefore receive greater shares of the wealth. The second rioter agrees, and they prepare their trap. Back in town, the youngest vagrant is having similar thoughts. He could easily be the richest man in town, he realizes, if he could have all the gold to himself. He goes to the apothecary and buys the strongest poison available, then puts the poison into two bottles of wine, leaving a third bottle pure for himself. He returns to the tree, but the other two rioters leap out and kill him.	They sit down to drink their friend’s wine and celebrate, but each happens to pick up a poisoned bottle. Within minutes, they lie dead next to their friend. Thus, concludes the Pardoner, all must beware the sin of avarice, which can only bring treachery and death. He realizes that he has forgotten something: he has relics and pardons in his bag. According to his custom, he tells the pilgrims the value of his relics and asks for contributions—even though he has just told them the relics are fake. He offers the Host the first chance to come forth and kiss the relics, since the Host is clearly the most enveloped in sin. The Host is outraged and proposes to make a relic out of the Pardoner’s genitals, but the Knight calms everybody down. The Host and Pardoner kiss and make up, and all have a good laugh as they continue on their way.​</h2><br />
