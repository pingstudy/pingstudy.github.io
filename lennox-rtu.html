                                            CONTEXT CLUE Read: THE SECRET GARDEN When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born, she handed her over to the care of an Ayah. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When other governesses came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all. Directions: Write the letter of the word on the right which was almost the same meaning as the word or phrase on the left. (COPY AND ANSWER) 1. Disagreeable-looking 2. Expression 3. Ill 4.

                                            Story
 Last year, the Girl Scouts in our district celebrated their anniversary with a j̲o̲u̲r̲n̲e̲y̲. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of journey?) The purpose of this trip was to explore the virgin 
 forests of Palawan, since the forests of Palawan have not yet been touched by loggers. Many of 
 the Girl Scouts who went were i̲n̲d̲e̲p̲e̲n̲d̲e̲n̲t̲ girls. (What do you think is the meaning of 
 independent?) and did not need help in doing basic or e̲s̲s̲e̲n̲t̲i̲a̲l̲ things like cooking and hiking. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of essential?)
 Learning the meaning of c̲o̲o̲p̲e̲r̲a̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ helped to make their trip a success. (Guess the
 meaning of cooperation.) By working together well, most of them learned much and enjoy the 
 trip. They learned the value of p̲r̲e̲s̲e̲r̲v̲i̲n̲g̲ or taking good care of our forests to avoid floods and 
 soil erosion. (What is the meaning of preserving?)

 She never remembered seeing f̲a̲m̲i̲l̲i̲a̲r̲l̲y̲ anything but the faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as t̲y̲r̲a̲n̲n̲i̲c̲a̲l̲ and selfish a little girl as ever lived.
 The young English g̲o̲v̲e̲r̲n̲e̲s̲s̲ who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When another governess came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So, if Mary had not chosen to learn how to read books, she would never have learned her letters at all.

 When Mary Lennox was sent to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the most d̲i̲s̲a̲g̲r̲e̲e̲a̲b̲l̲e̲-̲l̲o̲o̲k̲i̲n̲g̲ child ever seen. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour e̲x̲p̲r̲e̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India. She had always been i̲l̲l̲ in one way or another.
 Her father had held a p̲o̲s̲i̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ under the English government. He had always been busy and ill himself. Her mother had been a great beauty to cared only to go to parties and a̲m̲u̲s̲e̲ herself. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born, she ̲h̲a̲n̲d̲e̲d̲ her over to the care of an A̲y̲a̲h̲.
 She never remembered seeing f̲a̲m̲i̲l̲i̲a̲r̲l̲y̲ anything but the faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as t̲y̲r̲a̲n̲n̲i̲c̲a̲l̲ and selfish a little girl as ever lived.
 The young English g̲o̲v̲e̲r̲n̲e̲s̲s̲ who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When another governess came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So, if Mary had not chosen to learn how to read books, she would never have learned her letters at all.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>My research study is about the development and evaluation of a new educational technology platform for online learning.I chose this study because of the increasing demand for online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for more effective and engaging platforms to facilitate it.e-RTU is an acronym for "electronic Learning Resource and Training for Teachers and Students of the Rajabhat University." It is an educational technology platform developed for the Rajabhat University in Thailand.I chose this particular title for my research because it accurately reflects the main focus and purpose of the study.The scope of my study includes the design and development of the e-RTU platform, its implementation and evaluation in a real-world online learning environment, and the analysis of its effectiveness and user satisfaction.The phenomenon I am trying to understand with this research is the impact of a new educational technology platform on the online learning experience of teachers and students.Educators, students, and administrators of educational institutions will be most interested in my research.Yes, my research questions evolved during the process as I gained a better understanding of the potential impact and limitations of the e-RTU platform.I intended to bridge the gap between traditional face-to-face learning and online learning by providing a more interactive and engaging platform for remote education.My research is significant and important because it has the potential to improve the quality and accessibility of online learning, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.So far, my research has found that the e-RTU platform has been effective in enhancing the online learning experience of teachers and students, with high levels of satisfaction and engagement reported.My hypothesis was that the e-RTU platform would have a positive impact on the online learning experience of teachers and students, based on its innovative design and features.I chose a mixed-methods approach for my study, including both quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the e-RTU platform's effectiveness and user experience.Yes, I was expecting to find a positive correlation between the use of the e-RTU platform and improved learning outcomes and engagement.I related my study to the existing theories in the literature on online learning, educational technology, and instructional design, to provide a theoretical framework and context for my research.You should care about my research because it has the potential to inform and improve the future of online education, which is becoming increasingly important and prevalent in today's society.<p></p><br />

                            9. CONTEXT CLUE Read: THE SECRET GARDEN When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born, she handed her over to the care of an Ayah. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When other governesses came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.

 Last year, the Girl Scouts in our district celebrated their anniversary with a j̲o̲u̲r̲n̲e̲y̲. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of journey?) The purpose of this trip was to explore the virgin 
 forests of Palawan, since the forests of Palawan have not yet been touched by loggers. Many of 
 the Girl Scouts who went were i̲n̲d̲e̲p̲e̲n̲d̲e̲n̲t̲ girls. (What do you think is the meaning of 
 independent?) and did not need help in doing basic or e̲s̲s̲e̲n̲t̲i̲a̲l̲ things like cooking and hiking. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of essential?)
 Learning the meaning of c̲o̲o̲p̲e̲r̲a̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ helped to make their trip a success. (Guess the
 meaning of cooperation.) By working together well, most of them learned much and enjoy the 
 trip. They learned the value of p̲r̲e̲s̲e̲r̲v̲i̲n̲g̲ or taking good care of our forests to avoid floods and 
 soil erosion. (What is the meaning of preserving?)

By the time she was six years old she was as t̲y̲r̲a̲n̲n̲i̲c̲a̲l̲ and selfish a little girl as ever lived.</p><p></p><p>The young English g̲o̲v̲e̲r̲n̲e̲s̲s̲ who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When another governess came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So, if Mary had not chosen to learn how to read books, she would never have learned her letters at all.</p><p>Choose the letter of the word which has almost the same meaning. *</p><p>a. look b. job c. ugly d. sick e. entertain</p><p>1. disagreeable-looking </p><p>2. expression </p><p>3. ill </p><p>4. position </p><p>5. amuse </p><p>1. disagreeable-looking </p><p>2. expression </p><p>3. ill </p><p>4. position </p><p>5. amuse </p><p>Choose the letter of the word which has almost the same meaning. *</p><p>f. teacher g. gave h. nurse i. friendly j. bossy</p><p>6. handed </p><p>7.
