Bread - If Lyrics​If a picture paints a thousand words Then why can't I paint you?The words 	never show The youI've come to knowIf a face could launch a thousand ships Then where am I to go?There's no one home but youYou're all that's left me tooAnd when my love for life is running dry You come and pour yourself on meIf a man could be two places at one timeI'd be with youTomorrow and todayBeside you all the wayIf the world should stop revolvingSpinning slowly down to dieI'd spend the end 	youAnd when the world was throughThen one by one the stars would all go outThen you and I would simply fly away1 John 3:17But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Run the World (Girls)" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé, from her fourth studio album 4 (2011), released as the lead single from the album on April 21, 2011. It was written by Terius "The-Dream" Nash and Beyoncé, while heavily sampling "Pon de Floor" by Major Lazer written by Nick "Afrojack" van de Wall, Wesley "Diplo" Pentz, David "Switch" Taylor and Adidja "Vybz Kartel" Palmer. Production was handled by Switch, The-Dream, Beyoncé, and Shea Taylor. The song's development was motivated by Beyoncé wanting to do something different: a mixture of different cultures and eras, a new sound, and a message which would give women strength. An unedited demo of the song, then thought to be titled "Girls (Who Run the World)", was leaked on the internet on April 18, 2011. "Run the World" premiered on US radio on April 21, 2011, and was digitally released the same day.</p><br />
