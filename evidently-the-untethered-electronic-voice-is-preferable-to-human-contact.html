Selection 1
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching
her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the
sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the
doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books
and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye
and when she came near the point at which our ways
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This
happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her,
except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a
summons to all my foolish blood.
-excerpt from Araby by James Joyce
Questions:
1. What does the text tell us about the character’s feeling
towards the girl?
2. What can you conclude about the main character?
3. How does the character react when she sees the girl
every morning?
4. In your opinion, what will happen if the boy sees the girl
with another one?
Selection 2
For Conversation, press #1
by Michael Alvear
A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently and his cellphone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.
The park was filled with people talking on their cellphones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopiing to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.
the telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent.
Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, yo can just insert your card into the ATM. With vooice mail, you can conduct entire conversation without ever reaching anyone. If my Mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.
As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cellphone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn''t an option--They're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cellphoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when im home.

                                            Activity 4. Read to Find the Evidence Read the text below, then answer the questions that follow. For Conversation, Press #1by Michael Alvear I’ve got a cell phone, e-mail, and voice mail. So why am I so lonely? A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and–poof!–I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.  The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Recently I was in a car with three friends. The driver shushed the rest of us because he could not hear the person on the other end of his cell phone. There we were, four friends zooming down the highway, unable to talk to one another because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.  Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.  As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. You can’t even call a person to get the phone number of another person anymore. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated.  Pumping gas at the station? Why say good- morning to the attendant when you can swipe your credit card at the pump and save yourself the bother of human contact?  Making a deposit at the bank? Why talk to a clerk who might live in the neighborhood when you can just insert your card into the ATM?  Pretty soon you won’t have the burden of making eye contact at the grocery store. Some supermarket chains are using a self-scanner so you can check yourself out, avoiding those annoying clerks who look at you and ask how you are doing.  I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, an e-mail account. Giving them up isn’t an option–they’re great for what they’re intended to do. It’s their unintended consequences that make me cringe. More and more, I find myself hiding behind e-mail to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail picked up because I didn’t really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier–or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I’ve put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I’m home.

                            7. LEARNING TASK 4:
Read the text carefully and answer the questions that
follow. Write your answer on your pad paper.
Selection 1
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching
her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the
sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the
doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books
and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye
and when she came near the point at which our ways
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This
happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her,
except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a
summons to all my foolish blood.
-excerpt from Araby by James Joyce
Questions:
1. What does the text tell us about the character’s feeling

A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently and his cellphone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.
The park was filled with people talking on their cellphones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopiing to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.
the telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent.
Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, yo can just insert your card into the ATM. With vooice mail, you can conduct entire conversation without ever reaching anyone. If my Mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.
As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cellphone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn''t an option--They're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cellphoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when im home.

                            8. Activity 4. Read to Find the Evidence Read the text below, then answer the questions that follow. For Conversation, Press #1by Michael Alvear I’ve got a cell phone, e-mail, and voice mail. So why am I so lonely? A funny thing happened on the way to the communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and–poof!–I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The park was filled with people talking on their cell phones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopping to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.  The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Recently I was in a car with three friends. The driver shushed the rest of us because he could not hear the person on the other end of his cell phone. There we were, four friends zooming down the highway, unable to talk to one another because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.  Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.  As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. You can’t even call a person to get the phone number of another person anymore. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated.  Pumping gas at the station? Why say good- morning to the attendant when you can swipe your credit card at the pump and save yourself the bother of human contact?  Making a deposit at the bank? Why talk to a clerk who might live in the neighborhood when you can just insert your card into the ATM?  Pretty soon you won’t have the burden of making eye contact at the grocery store. Some supermarket chains are using a self-scanner so you can check yourself out, avoiding those annoying clerks who look at you and ask how you are doing.  I am no Luddite. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, an e-mail account. Giving them up isn’t an option–they’re great for what they’re intended to do. It’s their unintended consequences that make me cringe. More and more, I find myself hiding behind e-mail to do a job meant for conversation. Or being relieved that voice mail picked up because I didn’t really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier–or at least facilitating my antisocial instincts. So I’ve put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cell-phoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when I’m home.  What good is all this gee-whiz technology if there’s no one in the room to hear you exclaim, “Gee whiz”?A.

Readers Digest, pp. 143-145, July 2000 Questions: 1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel?" 2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of article? 3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author's opinion? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Due to less connectivity with the people and belongingness there is a loneliness and depression creates in a human technology is one of the main cause these days that creates disconnected from everyone and there will remain no social life.</p><p></p><p>2. I believe that the author came up with this kind of article is to remind us that because of our addiction to gadgets nowadays, we don't enjoy life as much as possible. Remember, we only live once so we need to savor and enjoy every single moment-memorable or horrible.</p><p></p><p>3. I strongly agree with the author's opinion. As a person who also became addicted to my phone and social media that sometimes I forget to do important tasks like studying. I also don't get to enjoy life. I remember that whenever we would travel, I would always be on my phone or I would be looking for wifi. But I think the beauty of traveling allows me to leave my gadgets and appreciate the world. Our gadgets may be useful right now with online classes and research.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Credits:FTO</p><br />
