Make sure that the theme is stated in complete sentence. Write your answers in one whole sheet of paper. "Midnight Collector" by Alm. Anonos-Carpio Yes, I am a collector I collect coins And stampo. And tonives. And books I gather the mementos of other lives lived separate from mine. I take each treasure in hand and trace my fingertips over every bump and groove, for I must remember how each of these things feels to my living hand I relish the paper cuts, the cuts from the keen blade edges. I relish the temporary infaglio of coins pressed to my palms. I relish the smells of book paper and dried ink, the scent of chamomile oil and forge-fire lingering on the steel of the unsheathed cutting edge. I immerse myself in the wordless stories of each of these things I gather to mark those private moments when I collect the shards of myself to put thern back together after the world shatters them. When I am no longer even a memory, these things will outlast me. When they, too. are dust, we will finally be inseparable, as we were once, when we were all part of a whole thing that has since been forgotten as I will be in the erasure of time's plodding. The world needs to forget to make room for those things that insist upon being remembered, if only for the time they exist, and shortly after they cease to be. Some things just must be consumed by midnight like a snack before they can come back. Revenants never stay gone for very long But they never come back the same, either. Now I begin a new collection, before my shadow fades into the intrepid darkness, never to return I open a fresh new box in which I place the faces I've collected. They are clean now, free of sinew and bone So are the knives, though the flensing and fillet blades will always carry the scent of blood and microscopic nicks from unfortunate jawbones. My hands tremble when I touch my treasures, you see. I am collecting faces, for when I lose my own Evidence from the text Implied Theme​</a>

Their player is worn on the wrist and allows users to change songs and the volume simply by pressing the thumb and forefinger together; once to change songs and twice to change the volume. This new feature could possibly make your player obsolete. You have the opportunity to obtain one of your competitor’s players, take it apart and examine it to explore their technology.

Make sure that the theme is stated in complete sentence. Write your answers in one whole sheet of paper. "Midnight Collector" by Alm. Anonos-Carpio Yes, I am a collector I collect coins And stampo. And tonives. And books I gather the mementos of other lives lived separate from mine. I take each treasure in hand and trace my fingertips over every bump and groove, for I must remember how each of these things feels to my living hand I relish the paper cuts, the cuts from the keen blade edges. I relish the temporary infaglio of coins pressed to my palms. I relish the smells of book paper and dried ink, the scent of chamomile oil and forge-fire lingering on the steel of the unsheathed cutting edge. I immerse myself in the wordless stories of each of these things I gather to mark those private moments when I collect the shards of myself to put thern back together after the world shatters them. When I am no longer even a memory, these things will outlast me. When they, too. are dust, we will finally be inseparable, as we were once, when we were all part of a whole thing that has since been forgotten as I will be in the erasure of time's plodding. The world needs to forget to make room for those things that insist upon being remembered, if only for the time they exist, and shortly after they cease to be. Some things just must be consumed by midnight like a snack before they can come back. Revenants never stay gone for very long But they never come back the same, either. Now I begin a new collection, before my shadow fades into the intrepid darkness, never to return I open a fresh new box in which I place the faces I've collected. They are clean now, free of sinew and bone So are the knives, though the flensing and fillet blades will always carry the scent of blood and microscopic nicks from unfortunate jawbones. My hands tremble when I touch my treasures, you see. I am collecting faces, for when I lose my own Evidence from the text Implied Theme​</h2><br />

Convergentboundary has three types depending on the type of crust present on either side of the boundary.The first type is the collision of two plates; one has continental edge while the other hasan oceanic edge. This event gives rise to the formation of a 7,__near the edge of acontinental leading plate. The reason for this is because the denser oceanic crust undergoes8.__process or the process where one plate is forced underneath the other. For the oceaniccrust, one important geologic feature is formed. The 9.___which is the deepest part of theocean.The second type is the convergence of two oceanic plates. Converging oceanic plateswill cause formation of trenches, and these trenches will become sources of earthquakes. Underwaterearthquakes can cause high sea wave ca led 10.__When two continental plates converge, a collision zone is formed. Unlike the other twotypes of convergent boundaries, subduction ceases for this particular type of convergence. No trench,no volcano, and definitely no island arc are created during this process. Instead, what is created is alarge group of tall mountains called 11.Moreover, a boundary produced when two plates slide past each other is called12boundary. Most of these types are located within the ocean basins, but thereare a few that cut through the continental crust. An example of this is the 13.fault.

                            30. As the designer of a very successful line of mp3 players, you believe that your products are on the cutting edge and that the features that you have designed into your product are state of the art. At a recent consumer electronics trade show, a new competitor has shown their mp3 player with some extraordinary features.
Their player is worn on the wrist and allows users to change songs and the volume simply by pressing the thumb and forefinger together; once to change songs and twice to change the volume. This new feature could possibly make your player obsolete. You have the opportunity to obtain one of your competitor’s players, take it apart and examine it to explore their technology. 
Should you do it and copy their design? Or, should you look at your own product and come up with your own design?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I should look at my own product and come up with my own design because copying makes the costumers lesser especially if they are using your competitors product they will say that you copied the design of the competitor and it will be a rumor but making it yourself design even though not much are buying still you made your best and if you make your own features they will say that the features are really good and the best.Just always remember that if you need something just pray and let your heart and god help you make it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps :)</p>#CARRY ON LEARNING<br />
