                                            Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                                            Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.

By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

                                            Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</a>

Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Cheating</p><p>2. Cheating is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students.</p><p>3. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials, can create mistrust, and sour the relationship between teachers and students, and bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace.</p><p>4. I agree with the reason that I believe, rather than cheat, students must learn how to balance their own time between studying and relaxing to be more productive, honest, and good students.

                            5. Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text- Grade 11/12 Read the text below and answer the questions that follow. Technician Education Can Fuel Financial Success NewsUSA It doesn't take a college degree to understand that a four-year education may not be the end-all and be-all it once was, according to a new survey of U.S. high school students. With rising costs for higher education and the way it equates to a career, more high school students say costs will be a "deciding factor in which college they attend or whether they end up going at all," according to the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit College Savings Foundation. The survey, which is in its 10th year, found that of the 500 students polled, this year saw the highest percentage (55 percent) say they are thinking about technical schools and career schools in the same way they look at traditional universities. This is good news for technical schools (most notably transportation technology and repair), that to date have had trouble attracting students through their doors. "There is more computer code in today's cars than there was used to put a man on the moon," says Jennifer Maher, chief executive officer of the TechForce Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports students through their education into successful careers as professional technicians. "These are skilled, well-paying, technical jobs. "To put this into perspective, according to Motor Authority, a Ford GT has more than 10 million lines of code and the new Ford F150 pickup has more than 150 million lines of code. Compare that to the shuttle's primary flight software, which contains approximately 400,000 lines of code, and it becomes easy to see the necessity of skilled technicians and the job security the industry represents. According to data from the 2020 AutoCare FactBook, the auto care industry added approximately 41,500 jobs in 2018, and automotive repair and maintenance showed the greatest increase ip average hourly wages among technician jobs from 2009 to 2018 More good news: The demand for skilled technicians continues to rise as older technicians retire. Additionally, those numbers increase as technicians move into other industries, and new positions open up. To this point, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the replacement rate plus the growth rate will translate to 78,200 per year from 2016 to 2026. TechForce's publicity campaign, "Because I'm a Tech," encourages technicians to share their Quipper School PREMIUM Teaching Guide READING AND WRITING SKILLS Unit 11: Development of a Text Grade 11/12 stories about how they have succeeded in skilled technician careers. Some of their comments: "i bought my first house at age 27," "I get to do something I love every day." "I have a good work/life balance and have time for my hobbies." Technician jobs can be an ideal alternative for many nontraditional learners who can think outside the box, and who enjoy working with their hands and solving problems. Plus, there's the fact that technicians can learn their skills as soon as two years after high school and put them to use right away without the time and expense of a traditional, four-year college degree. TechForce's FutureTech Roadmap to the transportation technology career highlights some of the traits that make for well-paid, successful technicians and how parents and students can identify these valuable skills. Middle School: Sixth-graders to eighth-graders who like to tinker; those who fix the wobbly bike wheel or design the winning car in the scouts' soapbox derby, may benefit from a technical school rather than a traditional college education. High School: The high schooler who helps design and build the sets for the school play may be the next great technician. Also, students with diagnoses of ADHD who learn best with hands-on lessons and struggle with lengthy, desk-bound assignments are ideally suited to many technician careers. Post-Secondary School: High school graduates with a strong interest in science and technology can launch fulfilling careers with training at an ASE-certified program. The more certifications and degrees earned, the higher the tech's earning potential from future employers. Short Response Questions Answer the following questions.

                            12. Tsinelas,
By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

                            25. Activity 1: Research Analysis 1. Below is a sample background of the study of research. Read It carefully and then determine the topic, problem statement, brief literature review and the research gap. Place your answer on a separate sheet of paper. (3 pts. each) The K to 12 Curriculum was adopted in the Philippines in the school year 2012-2013 utilizing the spiral progression approach especially in the fields of Math and Science under the Elementary and hmior High School Level. The spiral progression works in a way that the learners learn simpler or basic concepts during lower grades which becomes more complex as they progressed to a higher grade. This approach which was based from Bruner's theory of Learning would seek to help learners in their mastery of the lesson and retention as they progressed from one grade to the next grade until they finished schooling In the old curriculum, Earth Science is being tackled in the 1 year level, Biology in the 2nd year level, Chemistry in the 3rd, and Physics in the 4" level but with the new curriculum today, the four areas or fields are now being tackled in every level from Grade 1-10, onc field per quarter so the topics were decongested. As the students now progressed into senior high, they will still have to take science subjects regardless of their track and strand. In its first implementation, the students were confused on the focus of their discussions in one level until such time that they adapted to it already. The problem now is, as they go to a higher level, they tend to forget what they have learned in the previous years/levels especially the basic concepts that they need. From the case study on the use of spiral progression approach in teaching science conducted by Samala (2015), she found out that teachers encountered a problem on the retention of concepts learned among the students, wherein, teachers need to review the previous concepts leamed in order to refresh the minds of the students. Though this was effective for students in remembering the concepts, it posed a problem also to the teachers as well as the students. Teachers would consume much time in reviewing rather than starting a new lesson. In the worst case scenario, the allotted time for new lessons are already being used up in re-discussing the previous concepts since some students are requesting the teacher to rediscuss the topic. This poses also a problem to the other students who knew the topic already and this would result to boredom on their part and less motivation to learn. As supported by the study of Mangali, Tongco, Aguinaldo, Calvaderos (2019), one student said that they spend more time in discussing the past lesson and less time for the new lesson. Also, according to Romulo (2015) as cited by Capili, Capilitan, Sequete (2015), students are having difficulty in relating new topics being learned to the previous ones and they have less retention rate to the previous topics learned. This would imply that as the students progressed from one level to another, they tend to forget the concepts that they are learning, thus mastery of the subject matter is also poor. Retention of learned concepts is not only a problem in the Philippine context but also in other countries. In Nigeria alone, teachers had encountered a problem on the retention of concepts in Chemistry among senior high school students as well as in Ecology and for this, several studies were conducted to improve the performance of the students as well as their retention. With all the research and literatures cited, the studies focused on specific fields of Science such as Biology, Chemistry, and Ecology. In the Philippines alone, there were no studies conducted on the rate of retention among the senior high school students on their science subject as a result of the spiral progression approach in their junior high. Also, the concept on retention mentioned in the studies were results of the studies conducted but not the focus of the entire research. Therefore, this study aims to determine the rate of retention of senior high school students in the various fields of Science like Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, and Physics in which learned concepts from these fields are useful in their physical Science, Earth and Life Science/Earth Science subjects for all strands and General Biology 1 and 2. General Chemistry 1 and 2, General Physics 1 and 2 for STEM and GAS students as well as the factors which affect their rate of retention to fully determine the necessary interventions/actions to be made to improve their mastery of lessons leading to retention. This would also serve as the springboard for widening the area of the research in the Division of Baguio City to be able to remedy the problems on retention of concepts experienced by teachers of various expertise. Furthermore, this study could lead to the development of various learning materials and strategies to enhance learning.​</h2><br />
