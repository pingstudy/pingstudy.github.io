                                            INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

                                            2. The local high school recently passed a rule reducing how much teachers can count homework as part of a student's grade, Consequently, a larger portion of the students stop doing their homework. Ateacher there decides to conduct an experiment. All of his classes get an optional "lest guide" to help them study for their tests. He allows two classes hypothesizes that students will complete the test guides and learning will occur from filling them out. In his other 2 classes, the teacher does not allow students to use test guides on the exam, and consequently very few of them filled them out. After the 2017- 2016 year is over, he wanis io compare scores beiween ihe 4 classes on the final exam to see if allowing students to use test guides during each test throughout the year improved their later overall performance.INDEPENDENT VARIABLE:EXPERIMENTAL GROUP:DEPENDENT VARIABLE:CONTROL GROUP:I BRAINLIEST BEST ANSWER​</a>

I want to go over it together as aclass so you have enough time to study through the week," Mrs. Beckett explained."Do your best. This study guide looks a lot like the test."Math was difficult for Liam, so he was nervous about the test on ThursdayWith the right answers on his study guide, Liam went to his room every night thatweek and studied. He looked at the problems over and over. It didn't seem to behelping, though. Liam was still very nervous and he felt unprepared. What would theproblems look like on the real test? How would they be different than the studyguide?On Thursday, Liam took his seat in class. He sat next to the smartest girl in thegrade. He glanced over at her paper at the very beginning. Then, it became a habit.aAfter each question he finished, he looked at the girl's paper. He wanted to make surehe got them right. When his answer did not match the girl's, he changed his answer.He decided that she probably had the correct answer since she was so smart. Thepaper came back with a 100.

                            9. INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

I want to go over it together as aclass so you have enough time to study through the week," Mrs. Beckett explained."Do your best. This study guide looks a lot like the test."Math was difficult for Liam, so he was nervous about the test on ThursdayWith the right answers on his study guide, Liam went to his room every night thatweek and studied. He looked at the problems over and over. It didn't seem to behelping, though. Liam was still very nervous and he felt unprepared. What would theproblems look like on the real test? How would they be different than the studyguide?On Thursday, Liam took his seat in class. He sat next to the smartest girl in thegrade. He glanced over at her paper at the very beginning. Then, it became a habit.aAfter each question he finished, he looked at the girl's paper. He wanted to make surehe got them right. When his answer did not match the girl's, he changed his answer.He decided that she probably had the correct answer since she was so smart. Thepaper came back with a 100.
