Selection 1
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching
her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the
sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the
doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books
and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye
and when she came near the point at which our ways
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This
happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her,
except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a
summons to all my foolish blood.
-excerpt from Araby by James Joyce

Selection 2
For Conversation, press #1
by Michael Alvear
A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently and his cellphone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.
The park was filled with people talking on their cellphones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopiing to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.
the telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent.
Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, yo can just insert your card into the ATM. With vooice mail, you can conduct entire conversation without ever reaching anyone. If my Mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.
As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cellphone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn''t an option--They're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cellphoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when im home.
Questions:
1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it
that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I
feel?"
2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of
article?
3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author’s
opinion? Why or why not?</a>

Read the text carefully and answer the questions that
follow. Write your answer on your pad paper.
Selection 1
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching
her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the
sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the
doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books
and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye
and when she came near the point at which our ways
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This
happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her,
except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a
summons to all my foolish blood.
-excerpt from Araby by James Joyce
Questions:
1. What does the text tell us about the character’s feeling
towards the girl?
2. What can you conclude about the main character?
3. How does the character react when she sees the girl
every morning?
4. In your opinion, what will happen if the boy sees the girl
with another one?
Selection 2
For Conversation, press #1
by Michael Alvear
A funny thing happened in the way to communications revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently and his cellphone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and-poof! ---I became invisible, absent from the conversation because of a gadget designed to make communication easier.
The park was filled with people talking on their cellphones. They were passing other people without looking at them, saying hello, noticing their babies or stopiing to pet their puppies. Evidently, the untethered electronic voice is preferable to human contact.
the telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent.
Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communications technology is a setback to the intimacy of human interaction. With e-mail and instant messaging over the internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. In making deposit at the bank, yo can just insert your card into the ATM. With vooice mail, you can conduct entire conversation without ever reaching anyone. If my Mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine.
As almost every conceivable contact between human beings gets automated, the alienation index goes up. I am no Luddite. I own a cellphone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an e-mail account. Giving them up isn''t an option--They're great for what they're intended to do. It's their unintended consequences that make me cringe. So I've put myself on technology restriction: no instant messaging with people who live near me, no cellphoning in the presence of friends, no letting the voice mail pick up when im home.
Questions:
1. What is your understanding on this passage: "Why is it
that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I
feel?"
2. Why do you think the author came up with this kind of
article?
3. Upon reading the article, do you agree with the author’s
opinion? Why or why not?</h2><br />

According to Cook-Gumperz (1986), "The systematic development of literacy andschooling meant a new division in society, between the educated and theuneducated" (p. 27).2. Easton, B. (2008). Does poverty affect health? In K. Dew &amp; A. Matheson (Eds.),Understanding health inequalities in Aotearoa New Zealand (pp. 97-106).Dunedin, New Zealand: Otago University Press.3. Some educational theorists suggest that schooling and a focus on teachingliteracy divided society into educated and uneducated classes (Cook-Gumperz,I 1986)4. Kasabov, N., Scott, N.

Some argue that relying too much on the Internet for information might hinderour mental capacities and our ability to read books and other long pieces (Carr,2008).6. As mentioned by Carr (2008), "As we come to rely on computers to mediate ourunderstanding of the world, it is our own intelligence that flattens into artificialintelligence" (Chapter 3, para. 3).7. Andragogy is the method and practice of teaching adult learners (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 2005).8. Tyson, Strauss, and Gott (2016) encourage the use of simplified terms when itcomes to discussing and defining the universe. For example, a small white staris simply called a white dwarf. Keep it short and sweet because the universe isconfusing enough (p. 22).9. Tyson, N. D., Strauss, M. A., and Gott, J. R. (2016). Welcome to the universe:An astrophysical tour.
