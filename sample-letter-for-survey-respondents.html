Questionnaires can be either devised bythe researcher or they can be based uponsome readymade index3. As an alternative to mailing thequestionnaire, it is possible to hand them outdirectly to your potential respondents in yourchosen sampling frame4. All mailed questionnaires should beaccompanied by a covering letter and includea stamped, addressed envelope.5 Questionnaires are a useful option toconsider when conducting a postal survey6. Surveys are a modern way of conductingresearch7. In conducting a survey, alle issues arebest addressed by classical experimentaldesign where participants are randomized toeither an intervention group or a control group8.A survey of the entire population would be known as a sampling.9.Questionnaires can be cheaper than personal interviewing and. quicker if the sample is large and widely dispersed.10.Questionnaires  sent to populations with a covering letter from their general practitioner tend to have very high response rates.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Lack of standardization in the research process for distance education research. There are logistical issues surrounding the research process that need to be addressed. Oftentimes what seems like a streamlined process on paper does not necessarily pan out as such in actual implementation. DETA researchers expressed a top challenge for distance education research is translating the research plan into actual implementation at the designing stage, data collection stage, and analysis stage for distance education studies.
Incentivizing participation. Many distance education researchers face the obstacle of finding enough faculty and student participants to warrant a sound, evidence-based research project. Given the economic climate influencing many institutional resources, monetary incentives are unlikely, or the incentivization results in minimal participation. Thus, researchers face the difficulty of finding creative strategies for encouraging participation with limited resources.
Reliance on self-reported data. As with any research endeavor involving opinions and behaviors of humans, reliance on self-reported data means our data is ‘as good as the responses we ask for.’ The accuracy of self-reported data, without the availability of data for cross-checking, is unknown, which is a challenge in research conducted on student populations.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
