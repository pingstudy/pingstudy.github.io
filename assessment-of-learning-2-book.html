Expository, persuasive, narrative, and descriptive writing are the four main types of writing. Each of these writing techniques has particular language traits and goals. In many academic texts, you will need to use many types.</p><p></p><p>The most often used citation styles are APA and MLA, but CMS is also used; it's just less common among undergraduates. It is advisable to be aware that CMS is typically used in situations involving academic publishing and traditional book publishing if you are composing a post-graduate thesis. Four things are necessary for writing to be effective: audience recognition, goal clarification, message development, and style and tone choice.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about citation here:</strong> brainly.ph/question/2457726#</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
