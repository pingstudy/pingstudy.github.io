Later, private tutors taught the young Rizal Spanish and Latin, before he was sent to a private school in Biñan.</p><p></p><p>When he was 11 years old, Rizal entered the Ateneo Municipal de Manila. He earned excellent marks in subjects like philosophy, physics, chemistry, and natural history. At this school, he read novels; wrote prize-winning poetry (and even a melodrama—“Junto al Pasig”); and practiced drawing, painting, and clay modeling, all of which remained lifelong interests for him.</p><p></p><p>Rizal eventually earned a land surveyor’s and assessor’s degree from the Ateneo Municipal while taking up Philosophy and Letters at the University of Santo Tomas. Upon learning that his mother was going blind, Rizal opted to study ophthalmology at the UST Faculty of Medicine and Surgery. He, however, was not able to complete the course because “he became politically isolated by adversaries among the faculty and clergy who demanded that he assimilate to their system.”</p><p></p><p>Without the knowledge of his parents, Rizal traveled to Europe in May 1882. According to his biographer, Austin Craig, Rizal, “in order to obtain a better education, had had to leave his country stealthily like a fugitive from justice, and his family, to save themselves from persecution, were compelled to profess ignorance of his plans and movements. His name was entered in Santo Tomas at the opening of the new term, with the fees paid, and Paciano had gone to Manila pretending to be looking for this brother whom he had assisted out of the country.”</p><p></p><p>Rizal earned a Licentiate in Medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid, where he also took courses in philosophy and literature. It was in Madrid that he conceived of writing Noli Me Tangere. He also attended the University of Paris and, in 1887, completed his eye specialization course at the University of Heidelberg. It was also in that year that Rizal’s first novel was published (in Berlin).</p><p></p><p>Rizal is said to have had the ability to master various skills, subjects, and languages. Our national hero was also a doctor, farmer, naturalist (he discovered the Draco rizali, a small lizard; Apogania rizali, a beetle; and the Rhacophorus rizali, a frog), writer, visual artist, athlete (martial arts, fencing, and pistol shooting), musician, and social scientist.</p><br />

Summary of the differences and similarities between Rizal’s experiences in Ateneo and UST<br />B. Reflection on the significance of Rizal’s education in his life and works<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The early education of Jose Rizal was shaped by his mother, Teodora Alonso, who was a well-educated and cultured woman. She taught Rizal to read and write at an early age, and he was able to read books in Spanish and Tagalog before he even entered formal schooling. Rizal’s first formal education was at a local school in his hometown of Calamba, where he was taught by Justiniano Aquino Cruz. In 1872, Rizal went to Manila and attended the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where he completed his Bachelor of Arts degree. He then went on to study at the Universidad Central de Madrid in Spain, where he earned his degree in medicine and later a degree in philosophy and letters.</p><p></p><p>2. RA1425, also known as the Rizal Law, was signed into law on June 12, 1956, by Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay. The law mandates the inclusion of the study of the life, works, and writings of Jose Rizal in all public and private schools in the Philippines. The law recognizes the importance of Rizal’s contributions to the Philippine struggle for independence, and seeks to instill in Filipino students a sense of national pride and identity. The law has been controversial, with some arguing that it promotes hero worship and neglects other important figures in Philippine history.</p><p></p><p>3. Rizal’s life at the Ateneo and UST (University of Santo Tomas) were very different. At the Ateneo, Rizal was exposed to a liberal education that emphasized critical thinking and the development of the whole person. He was also introduced to the ideas of European Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire and Rousseau. In contrast, at UST, Rizal encountered the conservative, dogmatic teachings of the Spanish friars who controlled the institution. He was also exposed to the racism and discrimination that was prevalent in Philippine society at the time. Despite this, Rizal was able to excel academically at both institutions and use his education to become a leading voice in the Philippine nationalist movement.</p><p></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>o</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jesuit schools like ateneo are “guided by a spirituality that seeks justice,” they write. “Inspired by the tenets of Catholic social teaching and its intellectual and social justice traditions, a Jesuit education places great emphasis on forming 'women and men for others while Dominican system of education are established by mendicant friars living the Rule of St Augustine and have a communial life and community prayer where they follow religious beiefs disciplinary, learning and personal competences, inspired by Christian values, which enable them to perform and develop integrally in the workplace and in their environment, and through generation of knowledge, innovation and connection with the environment, in relevant areas. </p><p>What school are you from?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Rizal’s achievements in UST and Ateneo</strong>:Land Surveyor’s and Assessor's Degree (Ateneo)
Philosophy and Letters (UST)
Ophthalmology (UST)
<p></p><p>Rizal eventually earned a <strong>land surveyor’s and assessor’s degree</strong> from the Ateneo Municipal while taking up <strong>Philosophy and Letters</strong> at the University of Santo Tomas. Upon learning that his mother was going blind, Rizal opted to study <strong>ophthalmology</strong> at the UST Faculty of Medicine and Surgery.  </p><p>One of the reasons why he chose medicine was his desire to cure his mother’s growing blindness due to cataract. His grades in the medical course were “fair and good” unlike in Ateneo where he got excellent grades in all subjects. These gave Rizal a heavy heart for he knew he fared better than his peninsulares classmates.</p><p></p><p>After graduating with highest honor with the degree of Bachelor of Arts which was equivalent to only high school during the Spanish time in Ateneo, Jose Rizal decided to continue his studies in Manila.</p><p></p><p>Aside from his strong desire to finish his medical course due to his mother’s illness, there were <strong>three other reasons why Rizal decided to continue his studies abroad.</strong></p><p>1. The biased and hostile Dominican professor against him.</p><p></p><p>2. He was disgusted with the antiquated method of instruction in the University.</p><p></p><p>3. The racial discrimination that the Dominican professor had against Filipino.</p><p></p><p></p><p>More about Rizal studying in UST: https://brainly.ph/question/10427309</p><p>#BrainlyEveryday</p><br />

</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>
</p><p>After his medical studies at University of Santo Tomas, Rizal left the Philippines on May 3, 1882, and arrived in Madrid in September 1882. He took courses in medicine at Universidad Central de Madrid as well as painting at Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Calle Alcala.
</p><p>
</p><p>  </p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>He continues: “One of the reasons for Rizal’s frequent transfer from one boarding house to another and the search for the best possible rooming house was due to the fact that he wanted to look for a cheaper place in order to save, also the proximity of the place to his school, the tranquility of its neighborhood, for nights of study and writing; the state of the house itself and the composition of its tenants.”</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
