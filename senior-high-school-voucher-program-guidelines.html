                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This study was conducted to describe students' opinion of energy conservation and environmental issues during campus activities. It was a descriptive quantitative research using survey method. The subjects were 26 students of the first, second, and third-year students of Natural Science Department of Unesa. These students are pre-service teachers for senior high school level. The result shows that 43.75% students throw trash in different bins based on the material, 25% students take trash that is not thrown properly in campus area, and only 6.25% students clean their classroom after the class is over. This showed that their awareness of environmental condition is still low. Nevertheless, some students participated in weekly eco-campus activities. However, most of them join it involuntarily. The results also showed that they conserve the energy by turning-on lamp and air conditioner when it is needed only. It means that they know that they have to conserve although only some of students who doing that activities. In conclusion, some students are already aware about their environment and how to conserve the energy. So, they need more activities to enhance their awareness of environmental issues during campus activities, both in academic activities and non-academic activities.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Studies have shown that computer technology and website creation can have a positive impact on the academic performance of senior high school students in programming courses.</p><p></p><p>The use of computer technology in programming courses allows students to explore programming languages and concepts through hands-on learning experiences. Students benefit from improved problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and enhanced critical thinking skills. Computer technology provides an interactive and engaging platform for learning that encourages students to take an active approach to their education.</p><p></p><p>Website creation, in particular, allows students to apply their programming skills to real-world scenarios. It provides an opportunity for students to develop their abilities in web design, programming, and problem-solving. Students can also develop valuable teamwork and communication skills as they collaborate on website development projects.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the impact of computer technology and website creation on academic performance is significant. These tools help students to engage with programming concepts and acquire new skills that are applicable in everyday life. As such, computer technology and website creation are valuable educational resources that can help to improve student outcomes in programming courses.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>this is  only in my opinion ha?</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I don't see a problem on having a sex education to the curriculum of junior and senior high, in fact it will b very helpful for us. because nowadays a lot of teenagers get pregnant at the age below 20 so maybe just maybe the sex education can help decrease pregnant teenager's in our country so  i agree :)</p><p>Yes, I believe so, because most parents find it hard to explain sex to their children when they begin asking questions. When teenagers fall in love at this stage, are they ready to face the consequences? A teenager’s life is crucial because this is the time when they are attracted to the opposite sex. Adding sex education in the high school curriculum is a good move since this is the moment teenagers can fully understand the meaning of their existence.</p><p>students start having sexual urges at this age. With their shallow knowledge of the cause and effects of replicating acts they see on adult DVDs, this could result in unwanted babies and deadly diseases. Many of those who are against it are hypocrites since a lot of them who appear pious to the people are themselves titans of testosterone.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p>The transition from junior high school to senior high school can be a challenging time for students, as they are faced with new academic demands, social pressures, and the possibility of moving on to higher education or entering the workforce. One factor that can contribute to the struggles and adjustments of senior high school students is the mode of instruction they receive, with some students transitioning from online to face-to-face classes or vice versa.</p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the education of millions of students around the world, with many schools transitioning to online or hybrid learning models to mitigate the spread of the virus. While these measures have been necessary to protect the health and safety of students and staff, they have also posed significant challenges for students, teachers, and parents.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant challenges of online learning is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers. Research has shown that students who receive face-to-face instruction tend to perform better academically and have higher levels of engagement and motivation compared to those who receive online instruction. Additionally, face-to-face classes provide opportunities for students to participate in hands-on activities and experiential learning, which can be difficult to replicate in an online setting.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of senior high school students during face-to-face classes, including the struggles and adjustments they encounter. Through this research, we aim to gain a better understanding of the challenges faced by senior high school students in this context and identify potential strategies for supporting their academic and social development. This information may be useful for educators, policymakers, and other stakeholders in promoting the success and well-being of senior high school students during this critical stage of their education.</p><p></p><p>To conduct this study, we will use a mixed-methods approach, including both quantitative and qualitative data collection. We will survey a sample of senior high school students to gather data on their experiences during face-to-face classes, including their levels of engagement, motivation, and academic performance. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with a subset of students to explore their experiences in greater detail and gather more nuanced insights into their struggles and adjustments.</p><p></p><p>One of the key questions we will seek to answer in this study is how senior high school students adjust to face-to-face classes after experiencing online or hybrid learning. We will examine the differences in academic performance, engagement, and motivation between students who received face-to-face instruction prior to the pandemic and those who received online or hybrid instruction. We will also explore the role of support systems, such as teachers, peers, and parents, in helping students adjust to face-to-face classes.</p><p></p><p>In addition to examining the academic and social experiences of senior high school students during face-to-face classes, we will also consider the impact of other factors such as socio-economic status, gender, and cultural background. Previous research has shown that these factors can influence students' academic outcomes and experiences in school, and it is important to consider their role in the struggles and adjustments of senior high school students.</p><p></p><p>Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by senior high school students during face-to-face classes and to identify strategies for supporting their academic and social development. This information may be useful for educators and policymakers as they work to promote the success of all students, regardless of the mode of instruction they receive.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>face mask and alcohol  is no longer the mo </p><br />
